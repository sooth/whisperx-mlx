What is up guys, it's Andy Frisella and this is the show for the real, let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality. The motherfucking internet. That's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for. It stands for cruise the internet. I didn't know if you guys could figure that out. But what we do here is we put topics on the screen. We speculate on what's true and what's not true. And then we talk about how we, the people, have to solve these problems that all these knuckleheads create. Let's just get right into it. We don't run ads on the show. So we ask that you don't be a hoe. And you share the show. There you go. Yep. You're looking good, man. Is it? Damn. Yeah. I saw you trying to start work out, and I know what the fuck you're up to.

You cannot look back at the old footage. And be like, yeah. And be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real. Like, you just can't. If you do, I got, you know, some ocean property in Arizona, bro. Bro. Like, you just can't tell me that's real. I'm sorry. Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks. You know what I'm saying? they can well one's more truer than the other though yeah did you see that study i sent you about oh yeah dude that's sad bro the the stuff i said dj has studied today and they said that uh they ran some studies on people who actually transition so one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they transition they have a suicide a likelihood suicide rate of i think like 48 right and so doing the surgery saves their lives yes that's the justification for these people right now there's been a study that's come out does this say a recent study published in oxford's yeah well you know oxford they don't know what they're doing they trust science there yeah um oxford's journal of sexual medicine sampling 107 000 people found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender dysphoric individuals rather than reducing so uh who's counting man yeah i would have never guessed i would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis that eventually you're going to regret it you're gonna have some problems i would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts eventually you're going to regret it i would have never guessed if you sewed your vagina shut and put a piece of skin from your leg have known who would have known i mean i'm shocked bro i would be fucked up if i cut my penis off first of all it's a lot of cutting all right but but second of all not according to alex at dinner the other night bullshit no bullshit yeah bro shit yeah what do you mean what did i miss i wait what do you what'd she say what'd she say i don't know she said something i can't say it Bro, you can't just do that shit, man. And here's the thing. It's common sense, bro. Oh, it is. But here's the thing. This is a relatively new thing in our society. And the problem is that they were able to spout all of these justifications. There wasn't enough time for these type of studies to even come through. You got to follow that shit out. You know what I'm saying? It takes some time to get a good base of evidence there. And yeah, so I mean, it makes sense. But yeah, so I mean, chicks with dicks is more possible than going to the moon, though. Yeah. Yeah. though real quick. So you know Buzz Aldrin? I didn't know he was still alive. He's still alive. Is he? And they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time. It reports lunar gravity and it is stable. Come on. That's fake too. Oh, Conch, you mentioned here. Looks better than Andy is. He'll suck land. Okay. He's like, shit, so that's what it really looks like. Here's a picture they supplied. This is supposed to be... Who took the picture? I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, we all know the government's liars, and we all know NASA's liars, and we all know it's a massive money laundering scheme, just like all the other shit. How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA through different spiffs and perks and donations and funding. Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do, like, any real, like, you know, crazy shit. Like, you know, like, if they fuck with, like, any aliens or something. You know what I'm saying? Like, that maybe is the front. Like, it's a front for something. I'm a firm believer that the- I just said what it was a front for. It's a front for these people to get rich, bro. Yeah, but, like, I think originally, like, the whole reason we even did that was to, like, fucking, you know, funnel the money to cover up the fucking Cold War and shit, you know? I don't know. Beat the Russians, you know? That was the original motivation. But nobody went. That's right. Nobody fucking went, bro. They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War. I mean, that's what that was about. That was the basis of it, yeah. Race to the moon. Yep. We'll beat you. Out here in Arizona, you might as well stop. Get out of here. Yeah, man. It is what it is, man. But guys, hope you're ready for a show. Go to andyfrasella.com. You want to make people real mad? What? You tell them that the earth isn't flat. Oh, fuck. Now, hold on. Let me listen. The flat earthers are fucking passionate about it. No, listen. I mean, there's an argument. No, there's not. There's an argument, bro. We've been up in planes. What does it look like? You've seen what I've seen. I'm just saying, bro. 40,000 feet up. You motherfucking stick the earth flat? Joe does. Joe Young does. I know Joe Young does. Yeah, bro. We're ice shelfers. I think ice shelf could be true. No. If that's true, then the Earth's flat. I think. No. Yeah. No. Ice shelf theory is not about flat Earth. It's about. No, I'm not saying it is. I'm saying if that is true, though, then it would have to be true. No, there's still going to be some curvature. It's like a fishbowl. No, it's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head. Like you. little circle on your hat you wore one of them little hats you know those little tiny ones uh on your head which the the pointy ones or the no the little ones you know those little round hats a condom andy what are you talking about like what kind of kind of hat on my head you know all right anyway yeah man hey listen go to andy.com yeah go to andy for seller.com thing um let's get into our headlines man we got some some interesting stuff let's start with first uh first series of headlines headline number one um i wanted to get into this and this may be some foreshadowing going on i don't know but i i saw it and i immediately felt that this is not good so jd vance uh went to a ski trip um or tried to go to a ski trip um and this was supposed to be like you know like usually they don't announce the vacation shit until like you know he's already on right like that's a typical security thing right um i mean hell we don't really post where we are when we're there we post it after on the fucking plane ride home you know what i'm saying like that's a typical thing right um and so jd vance was supposed to be taking his family to this uh ski resort in vermont and before he even got there i don't know if you guys saw this there was uh some some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there all right now i mean jay what's the big deal here well if you got i mean first of all people don't understand the level of logistics that has to go into organizing even even a couple of hundred people together at the same time to get them into a specific location ahead of time this spells there is a fucking leak on his detail that needs to be removed there's no way there's no way that's not like how would they know that information ahead of time to even organize 500 fucking people In logistics, leaking inflation. Leaking that shit out, bro. And like I said, it wasn't a couple, bro. It was a shit ton of them. Yeah. Vance is a traitor. Go ski in Russia. Vance equals Putin's pawn equals traitor. So, dude, these people think that Putin is the problem. All the while, people are being arrested for making social media posts all through Europe. Okay? killing them who aren't European. Okay. We have people being arrested for praying in their homes already. Okay. And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already happening going on around them. Yeah. Right. Like, what are we, what are you guys fighting for? You know, these people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the media and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything. Right. And dude, did you see that that comment I got from I told I did I show you that comment I got from one of the people who follows me about the Ukraine shit? Yeah. He's like Ukraine's a sovereign nation. And, you know, we as the most powerful country in the world have a responsibility to stick up for countries that can't defend themselves. Well, let me stop you right there, homie. No, we don't. We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans. America first means America first. It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good. OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into. An actual war because of our involvement with NATO, they're sending troops in. to come out and how they do it. Yeah, right. Right. But they're supposed to be the people of peace and love and tolerance. And here we are. It's insane, dude. World War III on the doorstep. Yeah. For what reason? For what reason? Exactly. What reason? The only reason that these people all want this war, I'm not talking about these morons. I'm talking about the people who are actually making the decisions. Who write the shit on paper. Yes. Who are sending other people's children to die. because they don't want the truth to come out about how all these nations collaborate to oppress the citizens of humanity. Yep. Yep. One hundred percent, man. Like I said, I saw this and I just foreshadowing, bro, this is some dangerous shit. And they definitely need to lock that shit in. You know what I'm saying? Because we've seen what happens when you have leaks in your security team twice now with Donald Trump. I mean, fuck, J.D. Vance obviously being an incumbent potential running candidate for 2028. Be a good way to get them out beforehand. They got somebody fucking in this team. I'm telling you right now. A hundred percent, dude. There's no doubt. They need to watch it. Listen, this administration is still full with rats. It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens. You know, it's still full of this. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so what kicked off all of this Putin nonsense? of ukraine um now i will say this like i mean because we got plenty of criticism to give out here today on trump and the trump administration look what these people call him dude protester held sign labeling vance a traitor and nazi scum yeah you motherfuckers don't even know anything about nazi no you don't know it and and and you keep calling people nazis which is just emboldening people to come out with polarizing viewpoints the same thing they did with racism yeah dude exactly black people do still shit yeah like no bro that no you know what yeah it's almost good that they do this because they devalue their defense mechanism well their offense mechanism right right shut the fuck up or you're a nazi right shut the fuck up or you're a racist and that shit ain't working anymore no one cares and it just exposed how radical they are yes and what the truth that they actually are trying to push behind well unfortunately also it brings a it the surface the element that they claim to want to suppress um you know when you call everybody racist for 20 fucking years eventually they're like yeah you know what i am because i'm tired of getting called this and this and this from you fuckers fuck you simply right yeah like dude and what happens is you you end up radical they end up radicalizing people it works the opposite of You know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing. That's not good for society. Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that, you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either. Like, I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this. And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that. Because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks about their own race. america i've been told that i was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life so i never made my race my identity i never i never said yeah i'm fucking proud to be white that was never a thing i was always looking at everybody else just like mlk says dude the content of their character who they are you know and i think most people are like that and i think we're getting to a point where you know everybody's coming back to that and these people who are Oh, fucking Nazi. Bro, you don't even know anything about the history of fucking Nazi movement. You don't know anything of the history of World War I or World War II or how the Federal Reserve was formed. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, period. That's just it. No, it's stupid. They don't know. And they use these fucking terms, dude. I'm going to tell you what, man. I get called every name in the book now. I don't care. I like smile. I wear them as badges of honor. Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye's got a fucking swastika t-shirt? Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you. And you guys can get mad about that all you want. But he's forcing you to pay attention. And then when you look at the symbol and the history of a swastika, you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years. And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune and prosperity through human history. And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that. way why do you think he used that do you think he used that to represent evil in his mind that's what he was he was fighting for yeah he was in his mind he was fighting for what that symbol actually meant and then since then that symbol has been you know you can't fucking use it or you're a nazi well bro if you go to eastern cultures it's everywhere it's on the buildings My point in all of this, saying this, is like, these motherfuckers don't even know that. No. And it's like, and dude, let's pay attention. Who are these people? Who are they? What race are they? Oh, they're all white. Oh, they're all white. And what gender are they? All women. And what age are they? I mean, they're bruncher age for sure. And what are they wearing? Oh, they're wearing North Face. And they're wearing fucking $400 jackets. hmm well i guarantee you a lot of them probably these motherfuckers listen they got laid off from usa id yeah no for sure listen that group this group of people is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because they are so privileged they don't have any worries they fucking live in upper middle class areas and they drink champagne on sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and because they don't have any other meaning in their By the way, if you want to seem virtuous and care, stand up for the fucking right thing. Or actually go to Ukraine. Go fight in fucking Ukraine then. I don't want to hear it, dude. Go fight in Ukraine. I don't give a fuck. You know what? I'm America first. Period. I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel, or anybody else. Here first, then there. And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else. Doesn't matter who it is. Well, then maybe they should fucking work on that Makes sense to me man, but guys let's slow this down Let's let's let's talk about how we even got to you know, having you know, why the United States funds all these countries Do you know why because we have to know that's not why? United States adopted a strategy a long time ago They golden haven't count golden handcuffed these cut these countries. Okay, so they either say hey, we'll give you this a but you can't make this as part of the agreement, right? Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing. Or they give them the money knowing that the United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation. Any prosperity. Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source. It's no different than a rich kid, okay? You got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money. Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality? No. up and apply to a country okay if you keep foreign aiding a cut what i'm saying here is that we do this to handicap the other countries intentionally yeah and it needs to fucking stop yeah bro take them off the teat bro make them learn how to get the food the girls get strong or get conquered i don't give a fuck i don't care i'm american bro i care about us first do i care about people in europe yeah i got friends in europe do i care about people in australia yeah i do do i care sorry i don't i care about us yeah 100 bro um but yeah let's slow this down let's see where where this all started because we got to go back a couple of days to a meeting that that trump vance and zelinski had at the white house um and this was the first time we got to really see any type of negotiations i guess with the press corps being there um which i believe was part of trump's play i mean obviously because apparently word on the street is that this is exactly how zelinski was made the cameras available and everybody got to see us through color. So let's check this clip out. I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. Yes, but if you are not strong. Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president to bring it into this. Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have? to come once. I have actually I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people you bring them on a propaganda tour Mr. President. Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country? A lot of a lot of questions. Let's start from the beginning. First of all during the war everybody has Even you, but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. God bless. You don't know that. God bless. God bless. You will not have a war. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. Bro, that was a threat. Hold on. Stop it. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. That was a fucking threat. A hundred percent that was a fucking threat. A hundred percent. Fuck this little motherfucker. Throw him in the fucking wood chipper right there and the war ends. Nobody in Ukraine wants this war. No, bro. fucking wants the war because him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money get paid get paid bro that was a fucking diary bro you're sitting in the oval what i love about this though is i love how trump is immediately no i love how trump's sitting he's letting him talk yeah let's him talk let's him talk let's him talk let's him talk the guy gets one inch out of line and he said hold on and then let's play the fucking hammers him bro tell us what we're gonna feel i'm not You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good. You will feel influenced. We're going to feel very good and very strong. You will feel influenced. You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position, and he happens to be right about it. From the very beginning of the war, Mr. President, I was... You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards. I'm not playing cards. Right now, you don't... I'm very serious, Mr. President. You're playing cards. I'm very serious. of people. You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. It's back to you. Far more than a lot of people said they should have. Have you said thank you once? A lot of times. Even today. No, in this entire meeting that you said thank you, you went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October, offered some words of appreciation for the United States trying to save your country and your life look dude he's dead anyway they're gonna kill this bro listen not only that either side's gonna do it yeah for sure he's gonna kill this guy's fucking done they can't let that dude walk knowing like knowing what he knows bro no not only that no he stole dude he knows where all the money went he knows exactly where it went you know i'm saying they can't let that dude walk yeah see you know we call it how we see it a lot of people upset i saw this like you know i'm so embarrassed to be an american i'm so just listen dude you've never done anything that fucking matters okay real talk you've never had to fight for anything you've never had to negotiate for anything this is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men okay when people step out of line you step on their fucking face and that's He threatened our country, bro. Dude, and we got people in this country. What are we going to feel if we don't help? Brother, first of all, we got people in this country that fucking are on his side. Like, bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off. Go over there. Go live in Europe. Go live in Ukraine. They'll take you. And then they'll take you to the front lines like they're taking people with Down syndrome to the front fucking lines. Bro, I saw that clip. talking about, dude. You have no idea. You haven't been paying attention. You're sucked into your own life. You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit. And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing. You know what? You weren't embarrassed when our country was run by a literal vegetable. You weren't embarrassed when they stole all your money and closed your businesses and fucked with you. You weren't embarrassed when our whole country is a laughing world uh because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons running our country trans titties on the front row we got trans generals and you know we got kids we're promoting kids cutting off their dick and everybody else in the world is like the fuck is going on in the u.s you weren't embarrassed about that shit but you're embarrassed about this man and this other man who have finally That was the coolest, baddest-ass, gangster-ass shit that I've ever seen from either one of those guys. That's for sure, bro. So if you don't like it and that's embarrassing to you, then maybe you should fucking move. Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here. And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls, okay? I call it how I see it. If he does good, he does good. If he does bad, he does bad. That's great. That's not good. That's great. That's great. Okay? This motherfucker's stealing your money. And that's the problem. A lot of these people that are on, they're not working. They're not working. Right? So they don't see that tax be taken out of their check. And then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugattis. He's got two bugs? Yeah. Damn. Are they cool though? I mean, have you seen a bad Bugatti? Yeah, that's true. That's fair. I'm just saying, dude. That's not okay. No, it's cool for me to have two. You know what I'm saying? But I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it. Exactly. You know? Like, dude, fuck this guy. Yeah. No, I mean, well, so this is what started that whole chain of events, right? So you got- Bro, I hate this motherfucker. Oh, bro, I can't stand him. And I can't stand people standing up for him. It's stupid shit. But after he left the Oval Office, he decided to go back to Europe, and he did a little tour. Did you hear what he said today? Our troops. You got that clip? I can put it in. Bro, this guy gets on television today. You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up. This guy gets on TV today. Today is Monday. You're hearing this on Tuesday. And he fucking says the United States is going to have to send his sons and daughters to fight in Ukraine, and they will die. That's what he said. It's almost verbatim exact quote. single fucking soldier. This administration is no different than any other one. 100%. Yeah. Yeah, 100%, man. But yeah, I mean, he goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour, so he stopped in the UK. He went to the UK first. He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food they got over there. Gordon Ramsay's the only one who knows how to make food over there. That's why he's so fucking famous, bro. That's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous. Because he's the only one over there who knows how to make food
