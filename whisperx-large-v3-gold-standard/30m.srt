1
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:06,159
Sleepin' on the floor, now my jewelry box froze.

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:09,459
Fuck a bowl, fuck a stove, counted millions in a cold.

3
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:12,779
Bad bitch, booted swole, got her own bankroll.

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:16,139
Can't fold, just a note, headshot, case closed.

5
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:20,079
What is up guys, it's Andy Frisella and this is the show for the real.

6
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:23,319
Let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness, and delusions of modern society.

7
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:24,699
Welcome to motherfuckin' reality.

8
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:28,899
Guys, today we have Andy and DJ!

9
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:31,249
Cruz the motherfucking internet.

10
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,110
That's what we're going to do.

11
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,469
That's what CTI stands for.

12
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:34,889
It stands for Cruz the internet.

13
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:37,849
I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.

14
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:40,709
But what we do here is we put topics on the screen.

15
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:43,029
We speculate on what's true and what's not true.

16
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:48,669
And then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems that all these knuckleheads create.

17
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,189
Let's just get right into it.

18
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:53,329
We don't run ads on the show.

19
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,050
So we ask that you don't be a hoe.

20
00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,230
And you share the show.

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:00:59,711
There you go.

22
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,333
Yep.

23
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:01,990
You're looking good, man.

24
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:02,452
Is it?

25
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,932
Damn.

26
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,454
Yeah.

27
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,729
I saw you trying to start work out, and I know what the fuck you're up to.

28
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:07,550
What am I up to?

29
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:09,809
Trying to fucking catch up and beat me.

30
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,170
I can't let you.

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,542
I can't let you.

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,141
I can't.

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,381
Bro, you look good, man.

34
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:16,645
Shit.

35
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,542
You're looking good.

36
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,161
I don't know if it might just be the sweater.

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,581
I don't think it's the sweater, though.

38
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,302
No, it's my face.

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,862
Fuck, man.

40
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,642
Like, hey.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,225
Yeah.

42
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:23,842
What's up?

43
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,802
You tell me.

44
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,721
You look good, too, bro.

45
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,362
Thanks, man.

46
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,882
Pull me down.

47
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,324
Yeah.

48
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,261
We had a big event this weekend.

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,401
Dude, that was a big historic event.

50
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:32,924
Right.

51
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,981
Yeah.

52
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,185
Yeah.

53
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,578
Big Jim turns 80 years old yesterday.

54
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:39,601
Shit.

55
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:40,759
We went to dinner on Saturday.

56
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:41,519
It was a good time.

57
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,100
It was good.

58
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:43,019
It was a good time, man.

59
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:43,739
It's always nice.

60
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:44,559
It's always nice.

61
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,558
He was kind of surprised.

62
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:48,978
You know, he's been around, man.

63
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,938
It's hard to get him.

64
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:52,923
I mean, he's been around that many blocks.

65
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:53,328
Yeah.

66
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,143
I mean, he fought in the Civil War.

67
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,463
He's seen it, thank you, too.

68
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:01,105
That's for sure.

69
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:01,530
Yeah.

70
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:02,844
80 years.

71
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:03,484
Fuck, man.

72
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:04,464
That's a long time.

73
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:05,484
Yeah, still moving, though.

74
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:06,983
We ought to get him on the show, maybe.

75
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:08,724
I mean, if you got-

76
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:09,584
Do an interview of his 80 years.

77
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:13,323
Yeah, if you guys are ready for a six-hour podcast, let us know.

78
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:14,544
That's the truth.

79
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:16,823
It's going to be an all-day affair.

80
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:19,047
What else going on?

81
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,067
It'll be fucking good, though, man.

82
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:20,291
Yeah.

83
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,627
Yeah, everything is good, man.

84
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,127
You know, everything is good.

85
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:24,607
We got a lot to talk about.

86
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:25,528
I bet.

87
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:26,029
Yeah.

88
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:26,988
I bet.

89
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:28,507
Let's do some cruising.

90
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:29,168
Let's do it.

91
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:33,806
Before we get to our headlines, you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce

92
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,387
in there for you.

93
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:36,887
We just landed on the moon.

94
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:38,948
Who did?

95
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:39,768
We did.

96
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,027
Me and you?

97
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,007
No, like America.

98
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:42,549
Oh.

99
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:43,090
Yep.

100
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:43,828
Lunar Lander.

101
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:49,387
Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon.

102
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:50,092
This is the first time

103
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:53,353
ever

104
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:59,572
How about say, you know, I was gonna say, you know, I would believe this when chicks can grow

105
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:02,532
You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage

106
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:08,152
You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah and be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real like

107
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:10,653
You just can't.

108
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,172
If you do, I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.

109
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:17,634
Bro.

110
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:24,792
Like, you just can't tell me that's real.

111
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:25,194
I'm sorry.

112
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,912
Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.

113
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:28,793
You know what I'm saying?

114
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:30,652
Well, apparently they can.

115
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,212
Well, one's more truer than the other, though.

116
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,872
Did you see that study I sent you?

117
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,642
Oh, yeah, dude, that's sad.

118
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:45,621
Bro, I sent DJ a study today, and they said that they ran some studies on people who actually transition.

119
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:56,101
So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they transition, they have a likelihood suicide rate of, I think, like 48%.

120
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,361
Right, and so doing the surgery saves their lives.

121
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,841
Yes, that's the justification for these people.

122
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,261
But now there's been a study that's come out.

123
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:07,659
A recent study published in Oxford's.

124
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:08,719
Yeah, well, you know Oxford.

125
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:09,819
They don't know what they're doing.

126
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:10,879
They trust science there.

127
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:25,279
Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.

128
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:27,299
So it goes from 48 to 96.

129
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:29,739
I ain't going mad.

130
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:33,139
Who's counting, man?

131
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:33,442
Yeah.

132
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,586
I would have never guessed.

133
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:40,826
I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis,

134
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,406
that eventually you're going to regret it.

135
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:43,146
You're going to have some problems.

136
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:46,406
I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts,

137
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,046
eventually you're going to regret it.

138
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:53,006
I would have never guessed if you sewed your vagina shut

139
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:57,566
and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis,

140
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:58,806
that I would regret that.

141
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,606
I mean, who would have known?

142
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:02,286
Who would have known?

143
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,004
I mean, I'm shocked.

144
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:06,463
Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.

145
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:08,283
First of all, it's a lot of cutting.

146
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:10,263
All right, but second of all.

147
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,323
Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.

148
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:12,665
Bullshit.

149
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:13,324
No, bullshit.

150
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:13,784
Yeah, bro.

151
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:14,646
Yeah.

152
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:15,304
What do you mean?

153
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,163
What did I miss?

154
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,623
Wait, what did she say?

155
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:18,844
What'd she say?

156
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:19,345
I don't know.

157
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:20,084
She said something.

158
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:20,923
I can't say it.

159
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,143
I'll call her ass right now.

160
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:22,467
Yeah.

161
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:33,484
um no i mean but it makes sense bro you can't just do that man like and here's the thing

162
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:39,084
it's common sense bro it is but here's the thing this is a relatively new thing in our society and

163
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:44,124
the problem is is that they were able to spout all of these justifications there wasn't enough

164
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:48,204
time for these type of studies to even come through you got to follow that out you

165
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:51,244
know what i'm saying it takes some time to get a good base of evidence there

166
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,591
And, yeah, so, I mean, it makes sense.

167
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,831
But, yeah, so, I mean, Chicks with Dicks is more possible than going to the moon, though.

168
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,154
Yeah.

169
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:57,674
Yeah.

170
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,671
The funniest thing about this, though, real quick, so, you know, Buzz Aldrin?

171
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:03,474
Yeah.

172
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,311
I didn't know he was still alive.

173
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,912
He's still alive.

174
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,174
Is he?

175
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,491
And they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time.

176
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,131
It reports lunar gravity, and it is stable.

177
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,552
Come on.

178
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,352
That's fake, too.

179
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:21,255
Alcon, she mentioned her.

180
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:22,315
Looks better than any of you.

181
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:23,555
Y'all suck land.

182
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:26,117
Okay.

183
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:35,154
He's like, shit, so that's what it really looks like.

184
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,135
Here's a picture they supplied.

185
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:39,175
This is supposed to be.

186
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:39,895
Who took the picture?

187
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:43,496
I don't know.

188
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:44,579
Yeah.

189
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:50,826
Anyway, we all know the government's liars, and we all know NASA's liars,

190
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:55,366
and we all know it's a massive money laundering scheme, just like all the other shit.

191
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:59,006
How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA

192
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:03,946
and then filtered back through different SPFs and perks and donations and funding?

193
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:08,821
Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do, like, any real, like, you know, crazy shit.

194
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:11,821
Like, you know, like, if they fuck with, like, any aliens or something.

195
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:13,422
Like, that maybe is the front.

196
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,702
Like, it's a front for something.

197
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:16,462
I'm a firm believer that.

198
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:17,922
I just said what it was a front for.

199
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,681
It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.

200
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:26,861
Yeah, but, like, I think originally, like, the whole reason we even did that was to, like, fucking, you know, funnel the money to cover up the fucking Cold War and shit.

201
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:27,263
You know?

202
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:29,377
Beat the Russians, you know.

203
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:32,317
Well, that was the original motivation.

204
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,257
But nobody went.

205
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:35,119
That's right.

206
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:36,217
Nobody fucking went, bro.

207
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:40,417
They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.

208
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,397
I mean, that's what that was about.

209
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:43,417
That was the basis of it, yeah.

210
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:44,657
Race to the moon.

211
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:45,160
Yep.

212
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,338
We'll beat you.

213
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,097
Out here in Arizona, you might as well stop.

214
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:52,709
Yeah, man.

215
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:53,828
It is what it is, man.

216
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,248
But guys, hope you're ready for a show.

217
00:07:56,827 --> 00:08:01,767
Remember, if you wanted to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to andyfussella.com.

218
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:02,968
You want to make people real mad?

219
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:03,432
What?

220
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,408
You tell them that the earth isn't flat.

221
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:06,449
Oh, fuck.

222
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,308
Now, hold on.

223
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:07,829
Now, you listen.

224
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:10,308
The flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.

225
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:10,789
No, listen.

226
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,588
I mean, there's an argument.

227
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:13,569
No, there's not.

228
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,688
There's an argument, bro.

229
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,068
We've been up in planes.

230
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:16,789
What does it look like?

231
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:22,895
You've seen what I've seen.

232
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:25,835
I'm just saying, bro.

233
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:26,735
40,000 feet up.

234
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,015
You motherfuckers think the Earth's flat?

235
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:29,695
Joe does.

236
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:31,135
Joe Young does.

237
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,295
I know Joe Young does.

238
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:32,657
Yeah, bro.

239
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:33,475
We're ice shelfers.

240
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,115
I think ice shelf could be true.

241
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:36,401
No.

242
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:39,015
If that's true, then the Earth's flat.

243
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:39,796
I think...

244
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:40,915
No.

245
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:41,916
Yeah.

246
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:42,536
No.

247
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:45,214
Ice shelf theory is not about flat Earth.

248
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:46,740
It's about-

249
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:47,579
No, I'm not saying it is.

250
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:50,038
I'm saying if that is true, though, then it would have to be true.

251
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:52,118
No, there's still going to be some curvature.

252
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:53,359
It's like a fishbowl.

253
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:57,138
No, it's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head.

254
00:08:58,298 --> 00:08:58,899
Like you.

255
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:00,878
If you just drew a little circle on your hat.

256
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,938
You wore one of them little hats, you know, those little tiny ones on your head.

257
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,418
The pointy ones or the-

258
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:07,319
No, the little ones.

259
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,758
You know, those little round hats.

260
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:14,558
A condom, Andy?

261
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,278
What are you talking about?

262
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:18,117
Like, what kind of hat on my head?

263
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:19,818
You know.

264
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:20,239
All right.

265
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:21,999
Anyway.

266
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:22,718
Yeah, man.

267
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:23,418
Hey, listen.

268
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:24,777
Go to Andy.com.

269
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,165
Yeah.

270
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,537
Go to AndyFacella.com.

271
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
I wonder where it takes you to andy.com.

272
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,161
Is that a real thing?

273
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,600
Let's get into our headlines, man.

274
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,080
We got some interesting stuff.

275
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Let's start with first series of headlines.

276
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,021
Headline number one.

277
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
I wanted to get into this,

278
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,580
and this may be some foreshadowing going on.

279
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,380
I don't know, but I saw it,

280
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,240
and I immediately felt that this is not good.

281
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:48,281
So J.D.

282
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:52,216
Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.

283
00:09:53,255 --> 00:10:00,355
And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.

284
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:00,699
Right.

285
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:02,296
Like that's a typical security thing.

286
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:02,618
Right.

287
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,816
I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.

288
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:08,036
We post it after on the fucking plane ride home.

289
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:09,836
Like that's a typical thing.

290
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:10,100
Right.

291
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:11,582
And so J.D.

292
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:16,115
Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.

293
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:21,162
And before he even got there, don't know if you guys saw this.

294
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:27,822
There was some some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.

295
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:29,372
All right.

296
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:31,462
Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?

297
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:35,502
Well, if you got I mean, first of all, people don't understand.

298
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:45,447
The level of logistics that has to go into organizing even a couple of hundred people together at the same time to get them into a specific location ahead of time.

299
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:49,767
This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail that needs to be removed.

300
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:51,899
There's no way.

301
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:55,619
That's not, like, how would they know that information ahead of time?

302
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,079
To even organize 500 fucking people to get there.

303
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,859
Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.

304
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:02,879
Leaking that shit out, bro.

305
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,499
And like I said, it wasn't a couple, bro.

306
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:06,659
It was a shit ton of them.

307
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:07,025
Yeah.

308
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,240
Vance is a traitor.

309
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,219
Go ski in Russia.

310
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,179
Vance equals Putin's pawn equals traitor.

311
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:14,699
So, dude, these people.

312
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,607
think that Putin is the problem.

313
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:22,730
All the while people are being arrested for making social

314
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,382
media posts all through Europe.

315
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:25,227
Okay.

316
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:28,610
We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women

317
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,791
and stabbing people and killing them who aren't European.

318
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:33,118
Okay?

319
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:37,174
We have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.

320
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:38,178
Okay?

321
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:43,214
And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already happening?

322
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:44,075
Going on around them.

323
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:44,597
Yeah, right.

324
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:46,854
Like, what are you guys fighting for?

325
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:48,397
You know?

326
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:54,454
These people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the media,

327
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:59,134
and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.

328
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,246
All right.

329
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,612
And dude, did you see that?

330
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:09,065
That comment I got from I told I did I show you that comment I got from one of the people who follows me about the Ukraine shit.

331
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:09,868
Yeah.

332
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:12,416
He's like Ukraine's a sovereign nation.

333
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:20,705
And, you know, we as the most powerful country in the world have a responsibility to stick up for countries that can't defend themselves.

334
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,352
Well, let me stop you right there, homie.

335
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:23,065
No, we don't.

336
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:27,183
We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.

337
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:32,803
And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.

338
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:37,843
It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.

339
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:43,943
OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.

340
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,690
An actual war because of our involvement with NATO.

341
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,650
They're sending troops in.

342
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:02,510
They would rather blow up the entire world than to have the truth about the entire fucking system that oppresses citizens globally to come out and how they do it.

343
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:02,972
Yeah, right.

344
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,714
Right.

345
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,870
But they're supposed to be the people of peace and love and tolerance.

346
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,450
And here we are.

347
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,151
It's insane, dude.

348
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,311
World War III on the doorstep.

349
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:10,575
Yeah.

350
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,591
For what reason?

351
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,471
For what reason?

352
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,031
What reason?

353
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:19,282
The only reason that these people all want this war, I'm not talking about these morons.

354
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:23,362
I'm talking about the people who are actually making the decisions.

355
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:24,203
Who write the shit on paper.

356
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:27,662
Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.

357
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:35,762
The only reason they want to do that is because they don't want the truth to come out about how all these nations collaborate to oppress the citizens of humanity.

358
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:36,170
Yep.

359
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,023
Yep, 100%, man.

360
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:41,062
Like I said, I saw this, and I'm just foreshadowing, bro.

361
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:42,243
This is some dangerous shit.

362
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:46,163
And they definitely need to lock that shit in.

363
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:51,902
Because we've seen what happens when you have leaks in your security team twice now with Donald Trump.

364
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:52,984
I mean, fuck.

365
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:53,444
J.D.

366
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:58,502
Vance obviously being an incumbent potential running candidate for 2028.

367
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:01,283
I mean, bro, like, I mean, it'd be a good way to get him out beforehand.

368
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,903
They got somebody fucking in this team.

369
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:03,624
I'm telling you right now.

370
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:04,483
A hundred percent, dude.

371
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:05,403
There's no doubt.

372
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,491
They need to watch it.

373
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,630
Listen, this administration is still full with rats.

374
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,190
It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.

375
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,970
You know, it's still full of this.

376
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,218
Yeah.

377
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:18,761
Yeah.

378
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:23,739
Well, so what kicked off all of this Putin nonsense?

379
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:31,139
We got to go back a couple of days to this meeting that happened with Trump, Vance, and Zelensky of Ukraine.

380
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:38,519
Now, I will say this, because we got plenty of criticism to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.

381
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,860
Look what these people call him, dude.

382
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,299
Protester held sign labeling Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.

383
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:43,646
Yeah.

384
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,179
You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.

385
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,400
You don't know it.

386
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:54,919
And you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with polarizing viewpoints.

387
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:56,300
It's the same thing they did with racism.

388
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,080
Yeah, dude.

389
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:57,581
Exactly.

390
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,340
And now people are like, well, you know what?

391
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:01,924
Black people do steal shit.

392
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:02,247
Yeah.

393
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,424
I mean, it's like, no.

394
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:05,484
Bro, that, no.

395
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:06,464
You know what?

396
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:06,948
No.

397
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:13,384
It's almost good that they do this because they devalue their defense mechanism.

398
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,264
Well, their offense mechanism, right?

399
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,084
Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.

400
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:17,431
Right.

401
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:18,924
Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.

402
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:20,624
And that shit ain't working anymore.

403
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:21,305
No one cares.

404
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:21,508
No.

405
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,304
And it just exposed how radical they are.

406
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:24,747
Yes.

407
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:27,044
And what the truth that they actually are trying to push behind.

408
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:27,586
Well, unfortunately.

409
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:33,445
also it brings a it brings to the surface the element that they claim to want to suppress

410
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:40,625
um you know when you call everybody racist for 20 fucking years eventually they're like yeah you

411
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:45,466
know what i am because i'm tired of getting called this and this and this from you fuckers fuck you

412
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:51,965
simply right yeah like dude and what happens is you you end up radical they end up radicalizing

413
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:52,447
people.

414
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,550
It works the opposite of what they want.

415
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,590
They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.

416
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,192
Normal people.

417
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,290
You know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.

418
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,910
That's not good for society.

419
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:12,570
Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that, you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.

420
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,893
Like.

421
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:17,076
I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.

422
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:20,896
And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that.

423
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:26,016
Because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks about their own race.

424
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:30,356
And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,

425
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:33,696
I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.

426
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:36,456
So I never made my race my identity.

427
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:39,496
I never said, yeah, I'm fucking proud to be white.

428
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:40,897
That was never a thing.

429
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:48,173
I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says, dude, the content of their character, who they are, you know.

430
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:50,213
And I think most people are like that.

431
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:52,493
And I think we're getting to a point where.

432
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,503
You know, everybody's coming back to that,

433
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:57,663
and these people who are calling all the names

434
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,824
are going to be ostracized.

435
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:00,164
Like, nobody's listening to this shit.

436
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,684
We're fucking Nazi.

437
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:04,003
Bro, you don't even know what,

438
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:06,343
you don't even know anything about the history

439
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,663
of fucking Nazi movement.

440
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:10,583
You don't know anything of the history of World War I

441
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,503
or World War II or how the Federal Reserve was formed.

442
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:16,263
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

443
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:16,945
Period.

444
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:18,968
That's just it.

445
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:19,468
No, it's stupid.

446
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:20,168
They don't know.

447
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,347
And they use these fucking terms, dude.

448
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,387
And I'm going to tell you what, man.

449
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,127
I get called every name in the book now.

450
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:29,688
I don't care.

451
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:30,628
Yeah, I take it.

452
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:31,887
I mean, I like smile.

453
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,647
I wear them as badges of honor.

454
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:36,607
Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye's got a fucking swastika t-shirt?

455
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,427
Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.

456
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:44,314
And you guys can get mad about that all you want, but he's forcing you to pay attention.

457
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:51,614
And then when you look at the symbol and the history of a swastika, you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.

458
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:56,774
And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune and prosperity through human history.

459
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:59,334
And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.

460
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,534
Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?

461
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,561
Do you think he used that to represent evil?

462
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:07,801
In his mind, that's what he was fighting for.

463
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:13,201
Yeah, he was, in his mind, he was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.

464
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:18,161
And then since then, that symbol has been, you know, you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.

465
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:21,081
Well, bro, if you go to Eastern cultures, it's everywhere.

466
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,002
It's on the buildings.

467
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:25,361
It's, I mean, it's still, is that not true, Syed?

468
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:25,824
Yeah, sorry.

469
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:26,245
Yeah.

470
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:27,802
So, like.

471
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:34,210
You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.

472
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:34,557
No.

473
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,691
And it's like, and dude, let's pay attention.

474
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,911
Who are, let's, who are these people?

475
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,671
Who are they?

476
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,131
What race are they?

477
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,492
Oh, they're all white.

478
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,271
Oh, they're all white.

479
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,111
And what gender are they?

480
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,212
All women.

481
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,691
And what age are they?

482
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:52,979
I mean, they're bruncher age for sure.

483
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:54,299
And what are they wearing?

484
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:59,179
Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking $400 jackets.

485
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:00,082
Right, right.

486
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,399
Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably just got laid off from USAID.

487
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,439
Yeah, for sure.

488
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:09,279
Listen, this group of people.

489
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:15,737
is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because

490
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:20,937
they are so privileged they don't have any worries they live in upper middle class

491
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:26,777
areas and they drink champagne on sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and

492
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:31,257
because they don't have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to

493
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:36,057
seem virtuous and care stand up for the right thing the thing you go go actually go to

494
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:36,732
to Ukraine.

495
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:37,877
Go fight in fucking Ukraine.

496
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:38,998
I don't want to hear it, dude.

497
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,429
I don't give a fuck.

498
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:41,090
You know what?

499
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:42,189
I'm America first.

500
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,011
Period.

501
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,028
I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel, or anybody else.

502
00:19:47,448 --> 00:19:49,188
Here first, then there.

503
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:55,308
And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.

504
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,509
Doesn't matter who it is.

505
00:19:57,028 --> 00:20:02,048
And, by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.

506
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:05,493
Makes sense to me, man.

507
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,293
But guys, let's slow this down.

508
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:11,172
Let's talk about how we even got to having these protests.

509
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,193
You know why the United States funds all these countries?

510
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:14,853
Do you know why?

511
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:15,554
Because we have to.

512
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:15,957
No.

513
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:17,034
That's not why.

514
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:21,046
The United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.

515
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:25,726
They golden handcuffed these countries, okay?

516
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,026
So they either say, hey, we'll give you this aid,

517
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:30,126
but you can't make this and this and this and this and this

518
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:31,806
as part of the agreement, right?

519
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,666
Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.

520
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:38,066
Or they give them the money knowing that...

521
00:20:37,998 --> 00:20:42,238
The United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation.

522
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:43,159
Any prosperity.

523
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:46,278
Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.

524
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:47,738
It's no different than a rich kid.

525
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:48,422
Okay?

526
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:52,558
You got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep giving him money, keep giving him money,

527
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:54,618
keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money.

528
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:58,258
Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?

529
00:20:58,438 --> 00:20:58,588
No.

530
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,078
Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.

531
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:01,826
Okay?

532
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:05,618
If you keep foreign aiding a country, what I'm saying here is that...

533
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,040
We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally.

534
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,405
Yeah.

535
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,580
And it needs to fucking stop.

536
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,142
Yeah, bro.

537
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,181
Take them off the teat, bro.

538
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,560
Make them learn how to get the food themselves.

539
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,280
Get strong or get conquered.

540
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,760
I don't give a fuck.

541
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,721
I don't care.

542
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,040
I'm American, bro.

543
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,440
I care about us first.

544
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,200
Do I care about people in Europe?

545
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,401
Yeah, I got friends in Europe.

546
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,880
Do I care about people in Australia?

547
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,621
Yeah, I do.

548
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,560
Do I care about them more than us?

549
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,661
No, sorry, I don't.

550
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,361
I care about us.

551
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,380
Yeah, 100%, bro.

552
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:36,000
But yeah, let's slow this down.

553
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:42,279
Let's see where this all started, because we've got to go back a couple of days to a meeting that Trump, Vance, and Zelensky had at the White House.

554
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,319
And this was the first time we got to really see any type of negotiations, I guess, with the press corps being there.

555
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:51,156
which I believe was part of Trump's play.

556
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:58,715
I mean, obviously, because apparently word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind cameras.

557
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:03,456
And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see his true colors.

558
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:04,636
So let's check this clip out.

559
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,960
I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.

560
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,480
Yes, but if you are not strong...

561
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,040
Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office

562
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,040
and try to litigate this in front of the American media.

563
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,640
Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines

564
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,380
because you have manpower problems.

565
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,140
You should be thanking the President for trying to bring an end to this conflict.

566
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,880
Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?

567
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,383
I have been to...

568
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:31,084
Count once.

569
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,663
I've actually watched and seen the stories,

570
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,983
and I know what happens is you bring people,

571
00:22:37,283 --> 00:22:39,643
you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.

572
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:44,143
Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?

573
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:44,704
We have problems.

574
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:49,183
And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America

575
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:53,463
and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?

576
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:54,783
A lot of questions.

577
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,124
Let's start from the beginning.

578
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:56,370
Sure.

579
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:58,123
First of all, during the war,

580
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:05,994
Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future

581
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:08,704
God bless you don't know that God bless you.

582
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:09,474
God bless you

583
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:13,143
Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother was a threat.

584
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:14,234
Hold on stop it

585
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:17,252
That was a fucking hundred percent.

586
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,694
That was a fucking threat a hundred percent

587
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:22,029
Fuck this little motherfucker.

588
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:26,509
Throw him in the fucking wood chipper right there, and the war ends.

589
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,809
Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.

590
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:34,569
This motherfucker wants the war because him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.

591
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:35,170
You get paid.

592
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,261
Get paid, bro.

593
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,220
That was a fucking...

594
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,660
Bro, you're sitting in the Oval Office.

595
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:41,519
What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is...

596
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:41,921
Immediately?

597
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,384
No.

598
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,600
I love how Trump's sitting.

599
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:44,460
He's letting him talk.

600
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:44,724
Yeah.

601
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:45,461
Let's him talk.

602
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,041
Let's him talk.

603
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:46,561
Let's him talk.

604
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:47,141
Let's him talk.

605
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,699
The guy gets one inch out of line, and he said, hold on.

606
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,380
And then let's play the rest.

607
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,440
It fucking hammers him, bro.

608
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,800
Tell us what we're going to feel.

609
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,760
I'm not telling you.

610
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,760
Because you're in no position to dictate that.

611
00:23:58,879 --> 00:23:59,520
Remember this.

612
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:03,939
You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

613
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:06,789
We're going to feel very good.

614
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:10,257
We're going to feel very good and very strong.

615
00:24:10,337 --> 00:24:12,321
You're right now not in a very good position.

616
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:17,373
You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about it.

617
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:20,139
You're not in a good position.

618
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,004
You don't have the cards right now.

619
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,721
With us, you start having cards.

620
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,322
I'm not playing cards.

621
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,061
Right now, you're playing cards.

622
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,722
I'm very serious, Mr. President.

623
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,202
You're playing cards.

624
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,842
I'm very serious.

625
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,481
You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

626
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,901
You're gambling with World War III.

627
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,801
You're gambling with World War III.

628
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,141
And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.

629
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,721
It's back to you.

630
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,821
Far more than a lot of people said they should have.

631
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,021
Have you said thank you once?

632
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,436
A lot of times.

633
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,716
Even today.

634
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:54,756
You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.

635
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:58,576
Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America

636
00:24:58,555 --> 00:25:02,316
and the president who's trying to save your country.

637
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,496
And your life.

638
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:06,882
Look, dude, he's dead anyway.

639
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:07,943
They're going to kill this dude.

640
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:10,422
Listen, either side's going to do it.

641
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:10,983
Yeah, for sure.

642
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:11,643
He's getting killed.

643
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:12,722
This guy's fucking done.

644
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:15,702
They can't let that dude walk knowing what he knows, bro.

645
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:16,783
No, not only that.

646
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:17,563
No, he stole.

647
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:18,962
Dude, he knows where all the money went.

648
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:20,502
He knows exactly where it went.

649
00:25:21,282 --> 00:25:22,302
They can't let that dude walk.

650
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:23,030
Yeah.

651
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,833
See, you know, we call it how we see it.

652
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:30,420
A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset.

653
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:33,745
I saw this like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American.

654
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:38,091
I'm so dis listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters.

655
00:25:38,452 --> 00:25:38,812
Okay.

656
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:39,373
Real talk.

657
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:41,436
You've never had to fight for anything.

658
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,659
You've never had to negotiate for anything.

659
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,988
This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men.

660
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:50,649
Okay.

661
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,107
When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.

662
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:55,767
And that's what Trump does.

663
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:59,167
He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.

664
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:01,087
He just threatened our country, bro.

665
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:01,413
Dude.

666
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,847
And we got people in this country.

667
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,628
What are we going to feel?

668
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:04,031
Brother.

669
00:26:04,007 --> 00:26:04,528
If we don't help?

670
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:04,757
Wait.

671
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:05,111
Brother.

672
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:10,547
First of all, we got people in this country that fucking are on his side.

673
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:14,553
Like, bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.

674
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,754
Go over there.

675
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:16,714
Go live in Europe.

676
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:17,754
Go live in Ukraine.

677
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:18,395
They'll take you.

678
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:23,433
And then they'll take you to the front lines like they're taking people with Down syndrome

679
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,633
to the front fucking lines.

680
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:27,094
Bro, I saw that clip.

681
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:29,273
All you motherfuckers talking all this shit.

682
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,813
You don't know what you're talking about, dude.

683
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,154
You have no idea.

684
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:33,434
You haven't been paying attention.

685
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,273
You're sucked into your own life.

686
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:39,113
You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.

687
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,355
And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.

688
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:43,396
You know what?

689
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:48,015
You weren't embarrassed when our country was run by a literal vegetable.

690
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:50,015
You weren't embarrassed when...

691
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:55,296
They stole all your money and closed your businesses and fucked with you.

692
00:26:55,595 --> 00:27:00,536
You weren't embarrassed when our whole country is a laughingstock of the entire world

693
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:05,116
because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons running our country.

694
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:06,576
Trans titties on the front line.

695
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:09,736
Bro, we got trans generals and, you know, we got kids.

696
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,896
We're promoting kids cutting off their dick.

697
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,616
And everybody else in the world is like.

698
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:19,493
the fuck is going on in the u.s you weren't embarrassed about that shit but you're embarrassed

699
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:26,293
about this man and this other man who have finally said uh no you're not gonna fucking do this shit

700
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:33,713
here okay i actually thought in my opinion that was the coolest baddest ass gangster ass shit

701
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:38,753
that i've ever seen from either one of those guys for sure bro so uh if you don't like it

702
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,753
and that's embarrassing to you then maybe you should fucking move

703
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,208
Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.

704
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:48,768
And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls, okay?

705
00:27:48,808 --> 00:27:49,949
I call it how I see it.

706
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,228
If he does good, he does good.

707
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:52,469
If he does bad, he does bad.

708
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:53,509
That's great.

709
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:54,529
That's not good.

710
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:55,030
That's great.

711
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:55,570
That's great.

712
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:55,972
Okay?

713
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,148
This motherfucker's stealing your money.

714
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,408
You guys are out here working, and that's the problem.

715
00:28:01,488 --> 00:28:03,868
A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.

716
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,310
They're not working.

717
00:28:04,288 --> 00:28:04,552
Right?

718
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:08,268
So they don't see that tax be taken out of their check.

719
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:11,288
and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.

720
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,660
Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugattis.

721
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,401
He's got two bugs?

722
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,843
Yeah.

723
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,443
Damn.

724
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,861
Are they cool, though?

725
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,240
I mean, have you seen a bad Bugatti?

726
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,841
Yeah, that's true.

727
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,382
That's fair.

728
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,446
I'm just saying, dude, like, that's not.

729
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:27,207
That's not okay.

730
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:28,706
No, it's cool for me to have to.

731
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,546
You know what I'm saying?

732
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:34,546
But I didn't, you know, I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.

733
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:34,968
Exactly.

734
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,926
You know, like, dude, fuck this guy.

735
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:37,231
Yeah.

736
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:40,726
No, I mean, well, so this is what started that whole chain of events, right?

737
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:41,088
So you got.

738
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:42,026
I hate this motherfucker.

739
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:42,807
Oh, bro, I can't stand him.

740
00:28:42,785 --> 00:28:44,806
And I can't stand people standing up for him.

741
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:47,166
It's so, it's stupid shit.

742
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:54,790
But after he left the Oval Office, he decided to go back to Europe,

743
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,931
and he did a little tour.

744
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,011
Did you hear what he said today?

745
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,691
About our kids?

746
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,093
Our troops.

747
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,932
You got that clip?

748
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,792
I can put it in.

749
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,451
Bro, this guy gets on television today.

750
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,731
You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.

751
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:10,190
This guy gets on TV today.

752
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:11,510
Today is Monday.

753
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,270
Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.

754
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:22,329
And he fucking says, the United States is going to have to send its sons and daughters to fight in Ukraine, and they will die.

755
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:25,189
That's what he said, his almost verbatim exact quote.

756
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:34,089
Dude, if we send a single soldier over there, like a single fucking soldier, this administration is no different than any other one.

757
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:35,171
Yeah.

758
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,250
Yeah, 100%, man.

759
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:40,687
But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour

760
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,688
So he stopped to stop in the UK

761
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:44,742
He went to the UK first.

762
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:47,102
He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food.

763
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:47,707
They got over there

764
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:51,328
Gordon Ramsay's only one knows how to make food over there

765
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:55,748
That's why he's so fucking famous, bro

766
00:29:56,387 --> 00:30:00,267
That's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's the only one over there who knows how to make food
