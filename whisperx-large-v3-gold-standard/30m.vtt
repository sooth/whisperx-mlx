WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:06.159
Sleepin' on the floor, now my jewelry box froze.

00:06.278 --> 00:09.459
Fuck a bowl, fuck a stove, counted millions in a cold.

00:09.598 --> 00:12.779
Bad bitch, booted swole, got her own bankroll.

00:12.918 --> 00:16.139
Can't fold, just a note, headshot, case closed.

00:16.638 --> 00:20.079
What is up guys, it's Andy Frisella and this is the show for the real.

00:20.118 --> 00:23.319
Let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness, and delusions of modern society.

00:23.418 --> 00:24.699
Welcome to motherfuckin' reality.

00:24.818 --> 00:28.899
Guys, today we have Andy and DJ!

00:29.528 --> 00:31.249
Cruz the motherfucking internet.

00:31.368 --> 00:32.110
That's what we're going to do.

00:32.168 --> 00:33.469
That's what CTI stands for.

00:33.528 --> 00:34.889
It stands for Cruz the internet.

00:36.048 --> 00:37.849
I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.

00:38.448 --> 00:40.709
But what we do here is we put topics on the screen.

00:40.828 --> 00:43.029
We speculate on what's true and what's not true.

00:43.608 --> 00:48.669
And then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems that all these knuckleheads create.

00:49.828 --> 00:51.189
Let's just get right into it.

00:51.808 --> 00:53.329
We don't run ads on the show.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.050
So we ask that you don't be a hoe.

00:58.129 --> 00:59.230
And you share the show.

00:59.309 --> 00:59.711
There you go.

01:00.069 --> 01:00.333
Yep.

01:00.809 --> 01:01.990
You're looking good, man.

01:02.149 --> 01:02.452
Is it?

01:02.549 --> 01:02.932
Damn.

01:03.229 --> 01:03.454
Yeah.

01:03.829 --> 01:06.729
I saw you trying to start work out, and I know what the fuck you're up to.

01:06.889 --> 01:07.550
What am I up to?

01:07.729 --> 01:09.809
Trying to fucking catch up and beat me.

01:10.289 --> 01:11.170
I can't let you.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.542
I can't let you.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.141
I can't.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.381
Bro, you look good, man.

01:16.420 --> 01:16.645
Shit.

01:17.020 --> 01:17.542
You're looking good.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.161
I don't know if it might just be the sweater.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.581
I don't think it's the sweater, though.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.302
No, it's my face.

01:21.360 --> 01:21.862
Fuck, man.

01:22.020 --> 01:22.642
Like, hey.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.225
Yeah.

01:23.340 --> 01:23.842
What's up?

01:24.160 --> 01:24.802
You tell me.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.721
You look good, too, bro.

01:25.860 --> 01:26.362
Thanks, man.

01:26.340 --> 01:26.882
Pull me down.

01:27.020 --> 01:27.324
Yeah.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.261
We had a big event this weekend.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.401
Dude, that was a big historic event.

01:32.620 --> 01:32.924
Right.

01:32.960 --> 01:33.981
Yeah.

01:33.960 --> 01:34.185
Yeah.

01:35.898 --> 01:38.578
Big Jim turns 80 years old yesterday.

01:39.278 --> 01:39.601
Shit.

01:39.658 --> 01:40.759
We went to dinner on Saturday.

01:40.858 --> 01:41.519
It was a good time.

01:41.678 --> 01:42.100
It was good.

01:42.218 --> 01:43.019
It was a good time, man.

01:42.998 --> 01:43.739
It's always nice.

01:43.938 --> 01:44.559
It's always nice.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.558
He was kind of surprised.

01:47.678 --> 01:48.978
You know, he's been around, man.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.938
It's hard to get him.

01:51.423 --> 01:52.923
I mean, he's been around that many blocks.

01:53.103 --> 01:53.328
Yeah.

01:53.463 --> 01:56.143
I mean, he fought in the Civil War.

01:58.863 --> 02:00.463
He's seen it, thank you, too.

02:00.563 --> 02:01.105
That's for sure.

02:01.343 --> 02:01.530
Yeah.

02:01.963 --> 02:02.844
80 years.

02:02.923 --> 02:03.484
Fuck, man.

02:03.603 --> 02:04.464
That's a long time.

02:04.523 --> 02:05.484
Yeah, still moving, though.

02:05.463 --> 02:06.983
We ought to get him on the show, maybe.

02:07.723 --> 02:08.724
I mean, if you got-

02:08.703 --> 02:09.584
Do an interview of his 80 years.

02:09.643 --> 02:13.323
Yeah, if you guys are ready for a six-hour podcast, let us know.

02:13.803 --> 02:14.544
That's the truth.

02:15.443 --> 02:16.823
It's going to be an all-day affair.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.047
What else going on?

02:19.026 --> 02:20.067
It'll be fucking good, though, man.

02:20.066 --> 02:20.291
Yeah.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.627
Yeah, everything is good, man.

02:21.966 --> 02:23.127
You know, everything is good.

02:23.206 --> 02:24.607
We got a lot to talk about.

02:25.046 --> 02:25.528
I bet.

02:25.686 --> 02:26.029
Yeah.

02:26.426 --> 02:26.988
I bet.

02:27.346 --> 02:28.507
Let's do some cruising.

02:28.726 --> 02:29.168
Let's do it.

02:29.146 --> 02:33.806
Before we get to our headlines, you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce

02:33.786 --> 02:34.387
in there for you.

02:35.646 --> 02:36.887
We just landed on the moon.

02:38.366 --> 02:38.948
Who did?

02:39.306 --> 02:39.768
We did.

02:40.426 --> 02:41.027
Me and you?

02:41.166 --> 02:42.007
No, like America.

02:42.246 --> 02:42.549
Oh.

02:42.826 --> 02:43.090
Yep.

02:43.246 --> 02:43.828
Lunar Lander.

02:44.832 --> 02:49.387
Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon.

02:49.407 --> 02:50.092
This is the first time

02:51.332 --> 02:53.353
ever

02:55.152 --> 02:59.572
How about say, you know, I was gonna say, you know, I would believe this when chicks can grow

02:59.552 --> 03:02.532
You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage

03:02.592 --> 03:08.152
You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah and be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real like

03:09.892 --> 03:10.653
You just can't.

03:11.232 --> 03:17.172
If you do, I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.

03:17.212 --> 03:17.634
Bro.

03:17.772 --> 03:24.792
Like, you just can't tell me that's real.

03:24.832 --> 03:25.194
I'm sorry.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.912
Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.

03:28.132 --> 03:28.793
You know what I'm saying?

03:29.032 --> 03:30.652
Well, apparently they can.

03:30.712 --> 03:32.212
Well, one's more truer than the other, though.

03:34.272 --> 03:35.872
Did you see that study I sent you?

03:36.301 --> 03:37.642
Oh, yeah, dude, that's sad.

03:37.641 --> 03:45.621
Bro, I sent DJ a study today, and they said that they ran some studies on people who actually transition.

03:45.601 --> 03:56.101
So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they transition, they have a likelihood suicide rate of, I think, like 48%.

03:56.081 --> 03:58.361
Right, and so doing the surgery saves their lives.

03:58.361 --> 04:00.841
Yes, that's the justification for these people.

04:01.021 --> 04:03.261
But now there's been a study that's come out.

04:03.638 --> 04:07.659
A recent study published in Oxford's.

04:07.638 --> 04:08.719
Yeah, well, you know Oxford.

04:08.938 --> 04:09.819
They don't know what they're doing.

04:09.858 --> 04:10.879
They trust science there.

04:11.858 --> 04:25.279
Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.

04:25.378 --> 04:27.299
So it goes from 48 to 96.

04:28.298 --> 04:29.739
I ain't going mad.

04:31.878 --> 04:33.139
Who's counting, man?

04:33.118 --> 04:33.442
Yeah.

04:33.625 --> 04:36.586
I would have never guessed.

04:36.745 --> 04:40.826
I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis,

04:40.925 --> 04:42.406
that eventually you're going to regret it.

04:42.385 --> 04:43.146
You're going to have some problems.

04:43.285 --> 04:46.406
I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts,

04:46.445 --> 04:48.046
eventually you're going to regret it.

04:48.125 --> 04:53.006
I would have never guessed if you sewed your vagina shut

04:52.985 --> 04:57.566
and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis,

04:57.685 --> 04:58.806
that I would regret that.

04:58.925 --> 05:00.606
I mean, who would have known?

05:01.265 --> 05:02.286
Who would have known?

05:03.342 --> 05:04.004
I mean, I'm shocked.

05:04.102 --> 05:06.463
Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.

05:07.202 --> 05:08.283
First of all, it's a lot of cutting.

05:08.782 --> 05:10.263
All right, but second of all.

05:10.442 --> 05:12.323
Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.

05:12.322 --> 05:12.665
Bullshit.

05:12.762 --> 05:13.324
No, bullshit.

05:13.342 --> 05:13.784
Yeah, bro.

05:14.342 --> 05:14.646
Yeah.

05:14.822 --> 05:15.304
What do you mean?

05:15.382 --> 05:16.163
What did I miss?

05:16.282 --> 05:17.623
Wait, what did she say?

05:18.242 --> 05:18.844
What'd she say?

05:18.942 --> 05:19.345
I don't know.

05:19.422 --> 05:20.084
She said something.

05:20.202 --> 05:20.923
I can't say it.

05:20.962 --> 05:22.143
I'll call her ass right now.

05:22.242 --> 05:22.467
Yeah.

05:22.664 --> 05:33.484
um no i mean but it makes sense bro you can't just do that man like and here's the thing

05:33.464 --> 05:39.084
it's common sense bro it is but here's the thing this is a relatively new thing in our society and

05:39.064 --> 05:44.124
the problem is is that they were able to spout all of these justifications there wasn't enough

05:44.104 --> 05:48.204
time for these type of studies to even come through you got to follow that out you

05:48.184 --> 05:51.244
know what i'm saying it takes some time to get a good base of evidence there

05:51.790 --> 05:53.591
And, yeah, so, I mean, it makes sense.

05:53.670 --> 05:56.831
But, yeah, so, I mean, Chicks with Dicks is more possible than going to the moon, though.

05:56.870 --> 05:57.154
Yeah.

05:57.410 --> 05:57.674
Yeah.

05:58.710 --> 06:02.671
The funniest thing about this, though, real quick, so, you know, Buzz Aldrin?

06:03.210 --> 06:03.474
Yeah.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.311
I didn't know he was still alive.

06:04.390 --> 06:04.912
He's still alive.

06:04.910 --> 06:05.174
Is he?

06:05.790 --> 06:10.491
And they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.131
It reports lunar gravity, and it is stable.

06:16.950 --> 06:17.552
Come on.

06:17.610 --> 06:18.352
That's fake, too.

06:20.174 --> 06:21.255
Alcon, she mentioned her.

06:21.354 --> 06:22.315
Looks better than any of you.

06:22.874 --> 06:23.555
Y'all suck land.

06:25.734 --> 06:26.117
Okay.

06:33.094 --> 06:35.154
He's like, shit, so that's what it really looks like.

06:36.814 --> 06:38.135
Here's a picture they supplied.

06:38.254 --> 06:39.175
This is supposed to be.

06:39.254 --> 06:39.895
Who took the picture?

06:42.874 --> 06:43.496
I don't know.

06:44.334 --> 06:44.579
Yeah.

06:46.246 --> 06:50.826
Anyway, we all know the government's liars, and we all know NASA's liars,

06:50.846 --> 06:55.366
and we all know it's a massive money laundering scheme, just like all the other shit.

06:55.826 --> 06:59.006
How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA

06:58.986 --> 07:03.946
and then filtered back through different SPFs and perks and donations and funding?

07:04.201 --> 07:08.821
Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do, like, any real, like, you know, crazy shit.

07:08.901 --> 07:11.821
Like, you know, like, if they fuck with, like, any aliens or something.

07:12.361 --> 07:13.422
Like, that maybe is the front.

07:13.541 --> 07:14.702
Like, it's a front for something.

07:15.281 --> 07:16.462
I'm a firm believer that.

07:16.441 --> 07:17.922
I just said what it was a front for.

07:17.961 --> 07:19.681
It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.

07:19.961 --> 07:26.861
Yeah, but, like, I think originally, like, the whole reason we even did that was to, like, fucking, you know, funnel the money to cover up the fucking Cold War and shit.

07:26.841 --> 07:27.263
You know?

07:27.877 --> 07:29.377
Beat the Russians, you know.

07:29.737 --> 07:32.317
Well, that was the original motivation.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.257
But nobody went.

07:34.717 --> 07:35.119
That's right.

07:35.177 --> 07:36.217
Nobody fucking went, bro.

07:36.317 --> 07:40.417
They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.

07:40.397 --> 07:42.397
I mean, that's what that was about.

07:42.377 --> 07:43.417
That was the basis of it, yeah.

07:43.577 --> 07:44.657
Race to the moon.

07:44.837 --> 07:45.160
Yep.

07:45.757 --> 07:46.338
We'll beat you.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.097
Out here in Arizona, you might as well stop.

07:52.227 --> 07:52.709
Yeah, man.

07:52.747 --> 07:53.828
It is what it is, man.

07:53.867 --> 07:56.248
But guys, hope you're ready for a show.

07:56.827 --> 08:01.767
Remember, if you wanted to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to andyfussella.com.

08:01.767 --> 08:02.968
You want to make people real mad?

08:03.187 --> 08:03.432
What?

08:03.607 --> 08:05.408
You tell them that the earth isn't flat.

08:05.767 --> 08:06.449
Oh, fuck.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.308
Now, hold on.

08:07.287 --> 08:07.829
Now, you listen.

08:08.147 --> 08:10.308
The flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.

08:10.287 --> 08:10.789
No, listen.

08:10.947 --> 08:12.588
I mean, there's an argument.

08:12.927 --> 08:13.569
No, there's not.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.688
There's an argument, bro.

08:15.227 --> 08:16.068
We've been up in planes.

08:16.107 --> 08:16.789
What does it look like?

08:21.674 --> 08:22.895
You've seen what I've seen.

08:24.694 --> 08:25.835
I'm just saying, bro.

08:26.074 --> 08:26.735
40,000 feet up.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.015
You motherfuckers think the Earth's flat?

08:29.034 --> 08:29.695
Joe does.

08:30.034 --> 08:31.135
Joe Young does.

08:31.194 --> 08:32.295
I know Joe Young does.

08:32.334 --> 08:32.657
Yeah, bro.

08:32.674 --> 08:33.475
We're ice shelfers.

08:34.474 --> 08:36.115
I think ice shelf could be true.

08:36.214 --> 08:36.401
No.

08:37.154 --> 08:39.015
If that's true, then the Earth's flat.

08:39.254 --> 08:39.796
I think...

08:39.774 --> 08:40.915
No.

08:41.474 --> 08:41.916
Yeah.

08:42.094 --> 08:42.536
No.

08:42.914 --> 08:45.214
Ice shelf theory is not about flat Earth.

08:46.278 --> 08:46.740
It's about-

08:46.718 --> 08:47.579
No, I'm not saying it is.

08:47.618 --> 08:50.038
I'm saying if that is true, though, then it would have to be true.

08:50.018 --> 08:52.118
No, there's still going to be some curvature.

08:52.558 --> 08:53.359
It's like a fishbowl.

08:53.518 --> 08:57.138
No, it's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head.

08:58.298 --> 08:58.899
Like you.

08:59.278 --> 09:00.878
If you just drew a little circle on your hat.

09:00.918 --> 09:03.938
You wore one of them little hats, you know, those little tiny ones on your head.

09:04.138 --> 09:06.418
The pointy ones or the-

09:06.398 --> 09:07.319
No, the little ones.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.758
You know, those little round hats.

09:13.717 --> 09:14.558
A condom, Andy?

09:14.597 --> 09:15.278
What are you talking about?

09:15.477 --> 09:18.117
Like, what kind of hat on my head?

09:19.137 --> 09:19.818
You know.

09:19.877 --> 09:20.239
All right.

09:21.577 --> 09:21.999
Anyway.

09:22.177 --> 09:22.718
Yeah, man.

09:22.757 --> 09:23.418
Hey, listen.

09:23.817 --> 09:24.777
Go to Andy.com.

09:24.997 --> 09:25.165
Yeah.

09:25.217 --> 09:26.537
Go to AndyFacella.com.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.800
I wonder where it takes you to andy.com.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.161
Is that a real thing?

09:31.140 --> 09:32.600
Let's get into our headlines, man.

09:32.620 --> 09:34.080
We got some interesting stuff.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.160
Let's start with first series of headlines.

09:37.260 --> 09:38.021
Headline number one.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.680
I wanted to get into this,

09:39.800 --> 09:42.580
and this may be some foreshadowing going on.

09:42.620 --> 09:44.380
I don't know, but I saw it,

09:44.380 --> 09:47.240
and I immediately felt that this is not good.

09:47.635 --> 09:48.281
So J.D.

09:48.342 --> 09:52.216
Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.

09:53.255 --> 10:00.355
And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.

10:00.435 --> 10:00.699
Right.

10:00.715 --> 10:02.296
Like that's a typical security thing.

10:02.275 --> 10:02.618
Right.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.816
I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.

10:05.795 --> 10:08.036
We post it after on the fucking plane ride home.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.836
Like that's a typical thing.

10:09.855 --> 10:10.100
Right.

10:10.675 --> 10:11.582
And so J.D.

10:11.602 --> 10:16.115
Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.

10:16.762 --> 10:21.162
And before he even got there, don't know if you guys saw this.

10:21.222 --> 10:27.822
There was some some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.372
All right.

10:29.392 --> 10:31.462
Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?

10:31.802 --> 10:35.502
Well, if you got I mean, first of all, people don't understand.

10:36.387 --> 10:45.447
The level of logistics that has to go into organizing even a couple of hundred people together at the same time to get them into a specific location ahead of time.

10:46.027 --> 10:49.767
This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail that needs to be removed.

10:50.798 --> 10:51.899
There's no way.

10:52.558 --> 10:55.619
That's not, like, how would they know that information ahead of time?

10:55.918 --> 10:58.079
To even organize 500 fucking people to get there.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.859
Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.

11:01.838 --> 11:02.879
Leaking that shit out, bro.

11:03.298 --> 11:05.499
And like I said, it wasn't a couple, bro.

11:05.518 --> 11:06.659
It was a shit ton of them.

11:06.838 --> 11:07.025
Yeah.

11:07.418 --> 11:08.240
Vance is a traitor.

11:08.338 --> 11:09.219
Go ski in Russia.

11:10.278 --> 11:13.179
Vance equals Putin's pawn equals traitor.

11:13.618 --> 11:14.699
So, dude, these people.

11:15.790 --> 11:18.607
think that Putin is the problem.

11:18.949 --> 11:22.730
All the while people are being arrested for making social

11:22.710 --> 11:24.382
media posts all through Europe.

11:24.986 --> 11:25.227
Okay.

11:25.248 --> 11:28.610
We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women

11:28.590 --> 11:31.791
and stabbing people and killing them who aren't European.

11:32.834 --> 11:33.118
Okay?

11:33.274 --> 11:37.174
We have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.

11:37.894 --> 11:38.178
Okay?

11:38.254 --> 11:43.214
And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already happening?

11:43.314 --> 11:44.075
Going on around them.

11:44.274 --> 11:44.597
Yeah, right.

11:44.614 --> 11:46.854
Like, what are you guys fighting for?

11:48.014 --> 11:48.397
You know?

11:50.374 --> 11:54.454
These people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the media,

11:54.434 --> 11:59.134
and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.246
All right.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.612
And dude, did you see that?

12:02.516 --> 12:09.065
That comment I got from I told I did I show you that comment I got from one of the people who follows me about the Ukraine shit.

12:09.045 --> 12:09.868
Yeah.

12:09.928 --> 12:12.416
He's like Ukraine's a sovereign nation.

12:12.517 --> 12:20.705
And, you know, we as the most powerful country in the world have a responsibility to stick up for countries that can't defend themselves.

12:20.785 --> 12:22.352
Well, let me stop you right there, homie.

12:22.739 --> 12:23.065
No, we don't.

12:23.763 --> 12:27.183
We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.

12:27.383 --> 12:32.803
And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.

12:32.783 --> 12:37.843
It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.

12:38.443 --> 12:43.943
OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.

12:45.650 --> 12:48.690
An actual war because of our involvement with NATO.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.650
They're sending troops in.

12:50.970 --> 13:02.510
They would rather blow up the entire world than to have the truth about the entire fucking system that oppresses citizens globally to come out and how they do it.

13:02.570 --> 13:02.972
Yeah, right.

13:03.470 --> 13:03.714
Right.

13:03.690 --> 13:06.870
But they're supposed to be the people of peace and love and tolerance.

13:07.190 --> 13:08.450
And here we are.

13:08.470 --> 13:09.151
It's insane, dude.

13:09.430 --> 13:10.311
World War III on the doorstep.

13:10.370 --> 13:10.575
Yeah.

13:10.750 --> 13:11.591
For what reason?

13:11.810 --> 13:12.471
For what reason?

13:13.410 --> 13:14.031
What reason?

13:14.962 --> 13:19.282
The only reason that these people all want this war, I'm not talking about these morons.

13:19.542 --> 13:23.362
I'm talking about the people who are actually making the decisions.

13:23.342 --> 13:24.203
Who write the shit on paper.

13:24.282 --> 13:27.662
Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.

13:28.162 --> 13:35.762
The only reason they want to do that is because they don't want the truth to come out about how all these nations collaborate to oppress the citizens of humanity.

13:36.002 --> 13:36.170
Yep.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.023
Yep, 100%, man.

13:38.062 --> 13:41.062
Like I said, I saw this, and I'm just foreshadowing, bro.

13:41.062 --> 13:42.243
This is some dangerous shit.

13:43.802 --> 13:46.163
And they definitely need to lock that shit in.

13:46.742 --> 13:51.902
Because we've seen what happens when you have leaks in your security team twice now with Donald Trump.

13:52.362 --> 13:52.984
I mean, fuck.

13:53.142 --> 13:53.444
J.D.

13:53.465 --> 13:58.502
Vance obviously being an incumbent potential running candidate for 2028.

13:58.482 --> 14:01.283
I mean, bro, like, I mean, it'd be a good way to get him out beforehand.

14:01.542 --> 14:02.903
They got somebody fucking in this team.

14:03.002 --> 14:03.624
I'm telling you right now.

14:03.602 --> 14:04.483
A hundred percent, dude.

14:04.462 --> 14:05.403
There's no doubt.

14:05.570 --> 14:06.491
They need to watch it.

14:06.570 --> 14:10.630
Listen, this administration is still full with rats.

14:11.250 --> 14:15.190
It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.

14:15.430 --> 14:17.970
You know, it's still full of this.

14:18.050 --> 14:18.218
Yeah.

14:18.479 --> 14:18.761
Yeah.

14:19.366 --> 14:23.739
Well, so what kicked off all of this Putin nonsense?

14:23.719 --> 14:31.139
We got to go back a couple of days to this meeting that happened with Trump, Vance, and Zelensky of Ukraine.

14:32.459 --> 14:38.519
Now, I will say this, because we got plenty of criticism to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.

14:38.639 --> 14:39.860
Look what these people call him, dude.

14:40.019 --> 14:43.299
Protester held sign labeling Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.

14:43.459 --> 14:43.646
Yeah.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.179
You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.

14:46.559 --> 14:47.400
You don't know it.

14:47.559 --> 14:54.919
And you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with polarizing viewpoints.

14:54.939 --> 14:56.300
It's the same thing they did with racism.

14:56.279 --> 14:57.080
Yeah, dude.

14:57.159 --> 14:57.581
Exactly.

14:57.699 --> 14:59.340
And now people are like, well, you know what?

15:00.683 --> 15:01.924
Black people do steal shit.

15:01.943 --> 15:02.247
Yeah.

15:02.543 --> 15:03.424
I mean, it's like, no.

15:04.023 --> 15:05.484
Bro, that, no.

15:05.603 --> 15:06.464
You know what?

15:06.723 --> 15:06.948
No.

15:07.023 --> 15:13.384
It's almost good that they do this because they devalue their defense mechanism.

15:13.563 --> 15:15.264
Well, their offense mechanism, right?

15:15.623 --> 15:17.084
Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.

15:17.263 --> 15:17.431
Right.

15:17.443 --> 15:18.924
Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.

15:19.363 --> 15:20.624
And that shit ain't working anymore.

15:20.663 --> 15:21.305
No one cares.

15:21.283 --> 15:21.508
No.

15:21.723 --> 15:24.304
And it just exposed how radical they are.

15:24.463 --> 15:24.747
Yes.

15:24.803 --> 15:27.044
And what the truth that they actually are trying to push behind.

15:27.143 --> 15:27.586
Well, unfortunately.

15:27.565 --> 15:33.445
also it brings a it brings to the surface the element that they claim to want to suppress

15:33.425 --> 15:40.625
um you know when you call everybody racist for 20 fucking years eventually they're like yeah you

15:40.605 --> 15:45.466
know what i am because i'm tired of getting called this and this and this from you fuckers fuck you

15:45.445 --> 15:51.965
simply right yeah like dude and what happens is you you end up radical they end up radicalizing

15:51.945 --> 15:52.447
people.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.550
It works the opposite of what they want.

15:55.650 --> 15:59.590
They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.

15:59.730 --> 16:00.192
Normal people.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.290
You know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.

16:02.350 --> 16:03.910
That's not good for society.

16:04.370 --> 16:12.570
Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that, you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.

16:12.550 --> 16:12.893
Like.

16:13.516 --> 16:17.076
I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.

16:17.336 --> 16:20.896
And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that.

16:21.136 --> 16:26.016
Because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks about their own race.

16:26.496 --> 16:30.356
And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,

16:30.336 --> 16:33.696
I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.

16:33.796 --> 16:36.456
So I never made my race my identity.

16:36.576 --> 16:39.496
I never said, yeah, I'm fucking proud to be white.

16:39.556 --> 16:40.897
That was never a thing.

16:41.613 --> 16:48.173
I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says, dude, the content of their character, who they are, you know.

16:48.353 --> 16:50.213
And I think most people are like that.

16:50.193 --> 16:52.493
And I think we're getting to a point where.

16:53.223 --> 16:55.503
You know, everybody's coming back to that,

16:55.543 --> 16:57.663
and these people who are calling all the names

16:57.643 --> 16:58.824
are going to be ostracized.

16:58.903 --> 17:00.164
Like, nobody's listening to this shit.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.684
We're fucking Nazi.

17:02.303 --> 17:04.003
Bro, you don't even know what,

17:04.103 --> 17:06.343
you don't even know anything about the history

17:06.323 --> 17:07.663
of fucking Nazi movement.

17:08.103 --> 17:10.583
You don't know anything of the history of World War I

17:10.563 --> 17:13.503
or World War II or how the Federal Reserve was formed.

17:13.483 --> 17:16.263
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

17:16.443 --> 17:16.945
Period.

17:18.367 --> 17:18.968
That's just it.

17:18.967 --> 17:19.468
No, it's stupid.

17:19.447 --> 17:20.168
They don't know.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.347
And they use these fucking terms, dude.

17:23.387 --> 17:24.387
And I'm going to tell you what, man.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.127
I get called every name in the book now.

17:29.187 --> 17:29.688
I don't care.

17:30.027 --> 17:30.628
Yeah, I take it.

17:30.727 --> 17:31.887
I mean, I like smile.

17:32.087 --> 17:33.647
I wear them as badges of honor.

17:33.707 --> 17:36.607
Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye's got a fucking swastika t-shirt?

17:36.767 --> 17:38.427
Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.

17:39.173 --> 17:44.314
And you guys can get mad about that all you want, but he's forcing you to pay attention.

17:44.933 --> 17:51.614
And then when you look at the symbol and the history of a swastika, you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.

17:51.793 --> 17:56.774
And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune and prosperity through human history.

17:56.913 --> 17:59.334
And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.534
Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?

18:01.921 --> 18:04.561
Do you think he used that to represent evil?

18:04.901 --> 18:07.801
In his mind, that's what he was fighting for.

18:07.781 --> 18:13.201
Yeah, he was, in his mind, he was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.

18:13.281 --> 18:18.161
And then since then, that symbol has been, you know, you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.

18:18.461 --> 18:21.081
Well, bro, if you go to Eastern cultures, it's everywhere.

18:21.241 --> 18:22.002
It's on the buildings.

18:22.121 --> 18:25.361
It's, I mean, it's still, is that not true, Syed?

18:25.461 --> 18:25.824
Yeah, sorry.

18:26.001 --> 18:26.245
Yeah.

18:26.501 --> 18:27.802
So, like.

18:28.870 --> 18:34.210
You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.

18:34.370 --> 18:34.557
No.

18:35.570 --> 18:37.691
And it's like, and dude, let's pay attention.

18:37.790 --> 18:39.911
Who are, let's, who are these people?

18:40.910 --> 18:41.671
Who are they?

18:41.930 --> 18:43.131
What race are they?

18:43.850 --> 18:44.492
Oh, they're all white.

18:44.510 --> 18:45.271
Oh, they're all white.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.111
And what gender are they?

18:47.510 --> 18:48.212
All women.

18:48.490 --> 18:49.691
And what age are they?

18:50.318 --> 18:52.979
I mean, they're bruncher age for sure.

18:53.078 --> 18:54.299
And what are they wearing?

18:54.738 --> 18:59.179
Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking $400 jackets.

18:59.778 --> 19:00.082
Right, right.

19:00.798 --> 19:05.399
Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably just got laid off from USAID.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.439
Yeah, for sure.

19:06.418 --> 19:09.279
Listen, this group of people.

19:09.877 --> 19:15.737
is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because

19:15.717 --> 19:20.937
they are so privileged they don't have any worries they live in upper middle class

19:20.917 --> 19:26.777
areas and they drink champagne on sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and

19:26.757 --> 19:31.257
because they don't have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to

19:31.237 --> 19:36.057
seem virtuous and care stand up for the right thing the thing you go go actually go to

19:36.037 --> 19:36.732
to Ukraine.

19:36.752 --> 19:37.877
Go fight in fucking Ukraine.

19:38.057 --> 19:38.998
I don't want to hear it, dude.

19:39.408 --> 19:40.429
I don't give a fuck.

19:40.608 --> 19:41.090
You know what?

19:41.128 --> 19:42.189
I'm America first.

19:42.648 --> 19:43.011
Period.

19:43.308 --> 19:47.028
I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel, or anybody else.

19:47.448 --> 19:49.188
Here first, then there.

19:49.168 --> 19:55.308
And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.

19:55.508 --> 19:56.509
Doesn't matter who it is.

19:57.028 --> 20:02.048
And, by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.

20:04.332 --> 20:05.493
Makes sense to me, man.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.293
But guys, let's slow this down.

20:07.532 --> 20:11.172
Let's talk about how we even got to having these protests.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.193
You know why the United States funds all these countries?

20:14.152 --> 20:14.853
Do you know why?

20:14.912 --> 20:15.554
Because we have to.

20:15.712 --> 20:15.957
No.

20:16.492 --> 20:17.034
That's not why.

20:18.406 --> 20:21.046
The United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.

20:21.886 --> 20:25.726
They golden handcuffed these countries, okay?

20:25.946 --> 20:28.026
So they either say, hey, we'll give you this aid,

20:28.046 --> 20:30.126
but you can't make this and this and this and this and this

20:30.106 --> 20:31.806
as part of the agreement, right?

20:31.846 --> 20:33.666
Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.

20:34.126 --> 20:38.066
Or they give them the money knowing that...

20:37.998 --> 20:42.238
The United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation.

20:42.598 --> 20:43.159
Any prosperity.

20:43.598 --> 20:46.278
Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.

20:46.358 --> 20:47.738
It's no different than a rich kid.

20:48.178 --> 20:48.422
Okay?

20:48.438 --> 20:52.558
You got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep giving him money, keep giving him money,

20:52.638 --> 20:54.618
keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money.

20:54.598 --> 20:58.258
Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?

20:58.438 --> 20:58.588
No.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.078
Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.

21:01.658 --> 21:01.826
Okay?

21:01.878 --> 21:05.618
If you keep foreign aiding a country, what I'm saying here is that...

21:06.500 --> 21:09.040
We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally.

21:09.200 --> 21:09.405
Yeah.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.580
And it needs to fucking stop.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.142
Yeah, bro.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.181
Take them off the teat, bro.

21:12.180 --> 21:13.560
Make them learn how to get the food themselves.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.280
Get strong or get conquered.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.760
I don't give a fuck.

21:17.960 --> 21:18.721
I don't care.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.040
I'm American, bro.

21:20.180 --> 21:21.440
I care about us first.

21:21.620 --> 21:23.200
Do I care about people in Europe?

21:23.320 --> 21:24.401
Yeah, I got friends in Europe.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.880
Do I care about people in Australia?

21:26.080 --> 21:26.621
Yeah, I do.

21:26.940 --> 21:29.560
Do I care about them more than us?

21:29.680 --> 21:30.661
No, sorry, I don't.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.361
I care about us.

21:32.099 --> 21:33.380
Yeah, 100%, bro.

21:34.619 --> 21:36.000
But yeah, let's slow this down.

21:36.039 --> 21:42.279
Let's see where this all started, because we've got to go back a couple of days to a meeting that Trump, Vance, and Zelensky had at the White House.

21:43.059 --> 21:48.319
And this was the first time we got to really see any type of negotiations, I guess, with the press corps being there.

21:48.535 --> 21:51.156
which I believe was part of Trump's play.

21:51.355 --> 21:58.715
I mean, obviously, because apparently word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind cameras.

21:59.035 --> 22:03.456
And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see his true colors.

22:03.535 --> 22:04.636
So let's check this clip out.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.960
I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.480
Yes, but if you are not strong...

22:10.460 --> 22:14.040
Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office

22:14.020 --> 22:16.040
and try to litigate this in front of the American media.

22:16.360 --> 22:20.640
Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines

22:20.620 --> 22:22.380
because you have manpower problems.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.140
You should be thanking the President for trying to bring an end to this conflict.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.880
Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?

22:29.103 --> 22:30.383
I have been to...

22:30.363 --> 22:31.084
Count once.

22:31.083 --> 22:34.663
I've actually watched and seen the stories,

22:34.903 --> 22:36.983
and I know what happens is you bring people,

22:37.283 --> 22:39.643
you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.

22:40.123 --> 22:44.143
Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?

22:44.143 --> 22:44.704
We have problems.

22:44.683 --> 22:49.183
And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America

22:49.163 --> 22:53.463
and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?

22:53.463 --> 22:54.783
A lot of questions.

22:55.043 --> 22:56.124
Let's start from the beginning.

22:56.183 --> 22:56.370
Sure.

22:56.423 --> 22:58.123
First of all, during the war,

22:58.634 --> 23:05.994
Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future

23:06.374 --> 23:08.704
God bless you don't know that God bless you.

23:08.745 --> 23:09.474
God bless you

23:10.394 --> 23:13.143
Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother was a threat.

23:13.365 --> 23:14.234
Hold on stop it

23:15.254 --> 23:17.252
That was a fucking hundred percent.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.694
That was a fucking threat a hundred percent

23:20.588 --> 23:22.029
Fuck this little motherfucker.

23:22.668 --> 23:26.509
Throw him in the fucking wood chipper right there, and the war ends.

23:27.048 --> 23:28.809
Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.

23:29.408 --> 23:34.569
This motherfucker wants the war because him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.

23:34.668 --> 23:35.170
You get paid.

23:35.759 --> 23:36.261
Get paid, bro.

23:36.239 --> 23:37.220
That was a fucking...

23:37.199 --> 23:38.660
Bro, you're sitting in the Oval Office.

23:38.639 --> 23:41.519
What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is...

23:41.499 --> 23:41.921
Immediately?

23:42.159 --> 23:42.384
No.

23:42.499 --> 23:43.600
I love how Trump's sitting.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.460
He's letting him talk.

23:44.499 --> 23:44.724
Yeah.

23:44.859 --> 23:45.461
Let's him talk.

23:45.519 --> 23:46.041
Let's him talk.

23:46.079 --> 23:46.561
Let's him talk.

23:46.619 --> 23:47.141
Let's him talk.

23:47.679 --> 23:51.699
The guy gets one inch out of line, and he said, hold on.

23:52.299 --> 23:53.380
And then let's play the rest.

23:53.359 --> 23:54.440
It fucking hammers him, bro.

23:54.499 --> 23:55.800
Tell us what we're going to feel.

23:55.839 --> 23:56.760
I'm not telling you.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.760
Because you're in no position to dictate that.

23:58.879 --> 23:59.520
Remember this.

23:59.979 --> 24:03.939
You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

24:04.463 --> 24:06.789
We're going to feel very good.

24:06.829 --> 24:10.257
We're going to feel very good and very strong.

24:10.337 --> 24:12.321
You're right now not in a very good position.

24:12.843 --> 24:17.373
You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about it.

24:18.075 --> 24:20.139
You're not in a good position.

24:20.340 --> 24:22.004
You don't have the cards right now.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.721
With us, you start having cards.

24:23.700 --> 24:24.322
I'm not playing cards.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.061
Right now, you're playing cards.

24:26.040 --> 24:26.722
I'm very serious, Mr. President.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.202
You're playing cards.

24:27.180 --> 24:27.842
I'm very serious.

24:27.820 --> 24:30.481
You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.901
You're gambling with World War III.

24:33.220 --> 24:35.801
You're gambling with World War III.

24:36.420 --> 24:41.141
And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.

24:41.420 --> 24:42.721
It's back to you.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.821
Far more than a lot of people said they should have.

24:45.820 --> 24:47.021
Have you said thank you once?

24:47.275 --> 24:48.436
A lot of times.

24:48.555 --> 24:49.716
Even today.

24:51.135 --> 24:54.756
You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.

24:55.235 --> 24:58.576
Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America

24:58.555 --> 25:02.316
and the president who's trying to save your country.

25:03.635 --> 25:04.496
And your life.

25:05.602 --> 25:06.882
Look, dude, he's dead anyway.

25:07.162 --> 25:07.943
They're going to kill this dude.

25:08.242 --> 25:10.422
Listen, either side's going to do it.

25:10.462 --> 25:10.983
Yeah, for sure.

25:11.002 --> 25:11.643
He's getting killed.

25:11.762 --> 25:12.722
This guy's fucking done.

25:12.862 --> 25:15.702
They can't let that dude walk knowing what he knows, bro.

25:15.882 --> 25:16.783
No, not only that.

25:16.882 --> 25:17.563
No, he stole.

25:17.742 --> 25:18.962
Dude, he knows where all the money went.

25:18.962 --> 25:20.502
He knows exactly where it went.

25:21.282 --> 25:22.302
They can't let that dude walk.

25:22.409 --> 25:23.030
Yeah.

25:23.050 --> 25:24.833
See, you know, we call it how we see it.

25:25.253 --> 25:30.420
A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset.

25:30.481 --> 25:33.745
I saw this like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American.

25:33.785 --> 25:38.091
I'm so dis listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters.

25:38.452 --> 25:38.812
Okay.

25:38.852 --> 25:39.373
Real talk.

25:39.814 --> 25:41.436
You've never had to fight for anything.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.659
You've never had to negotiate for anything.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.988
This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men.

25:50.449 --> 25:50.649
Okay.

25:51.367 --> 25:54.107
When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.767
And that's what Trump does.

25:55.927 --> 25:59.167
He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.

25:59.387 --> 26:01.087
He just threatened our country, bro.

26:01.227 --> 26:01.413
Dude.

26:01.627 --> 26:02.847
And we got people in this country.

26:02.827 --> 26:03.628
What are we going to feel?

26:03.767 --> 26:04.031
Brother.

26:04.007 --> 26:04.528
If we don't help?

26:04.607 --> 26:04.757
Wait.

26:04.847 --> 26:05.111
Brother.

26:05.307 --> 26:10.547
First of all, we got people in this country that fucking are on his side.

26:11.313 --> 26:14.553
Like, bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.

26:15.073 --> 26:15.754
Go over there.

26:16.033 --> 26:16.714
Go live in Europe.

26:16.953 --> 26:17.754
Go live in Ukraine.

26:17.853 --> 26:18.395
They'll take you.

26:18.913 --> 26:23.433
And then they'll take you to the front lines like they're taking people with Down syndrome

26:23.413 --> 26:25.633
to the front fucking lines.

26:25.893 --> 26:27.094
Bro, I saw that clip.

26:27.233 --> 26:29.273
All you motherfuckers talking all this shit.

26:29.333 --> 26:30.813
You don't know what you're talking about, dude.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.154
You have no idea.

26:32.213 --> 26:33.434
You haven't been paying attention.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.273
You're sucked into your own life.

26:35.253 --> 26:39.113
You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.355
And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.

26:42.795 --> 26:43.396
You know what?

26:44.155 --> 26:48.015
You weren't embarrassed when our country was run by a literal vegetable.

26:47.995 --> 26:50.015
You weren't embarrassed when...

26:51.475 --> 26:55.296
They stole all your money and closed your businesses and fucked with you.

26:55.595 --> 27:00.536
You weren't embarrassed when our whole country is a laughingstock of the entire world

27:00.515 --> 27:05.116
because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons running our country.

27:05.335 --> 27:06.576
Trans titties on the front line.

27:06.555 --> 27:09.736
Bro, we got trans generals and, you know, we got kids.

27:09.835 --> 27:11.896
We're promoting kids cutting off their dick.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.616
And everybody else in the world is like.

27:14.493 --> 27:19.493
the fuck is going on in the u.s you weren't embarrassed about that shit but you're embarrassed

27:19.473 --> 27:26.293
about this man and this other man who have finally said uh no you're not gonna fucking do this shit

27:26.273 --> 27:33.713
here okay i actually thought in my opinion that was the coolest baddest ass gangster ass shit

27:33.693 --> 27:38.753
that i've ever seen from either one of those guys for sure bro so uh if you don't like it

27:38.733 --> 27:41.753
and that's embarrassing to you then maybe you should fucking move

27:42.168 --> 27:45.208
Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.

27:45.548 --> 27:48.768
And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls, okay?

27:48.808 --> 27:49.949
I call it how I see it.

27:49.948 --> 27:51.228
If he does good, he does good.

27:51.248 --> 27:52.469
If he does bad, he does bad.

27:52.808 --> 27:53.509
That's great.

27:53.948 --> 27:54.529
That's not good.

27:54.568 --> 27:55.030
That's great.

27:55.168 --> 27:55.570
That's great.

27:55.708 --> 27:55.972
Okay?

27:56.308 --> 27:58.148
This motherfucker's stealing your money.

27:58.428 --> 28:01.408
You guys are out here working, and that's the problem.

28:01.488 --> 28:03.868
A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.310
They're not working.

28:04.288 --> 28:04.552
Right?

28:04.668 --> 28:08.268
So they don't see that tax be taken out of their check.

28:08.248 --> 28:11.288
and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.

28:12.020 --> 28:16.660
Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugattis.

28:17.740 --> 28:18.401
He's got two bugs?

28:18.560 --> 28:18.843
Yeah.

28:19.120 --> 28:19.443
Damn.

28:20.220 --> 28:20.861
Are they cool, though?

28:21.560 --> 28:23.240
I mean, have you seen a bad Bugatti?

28:23.300 --> 28:23.841
Yeah, that's true.

28:23.940 --> 28:24.382
That's fair.

28:24.625 --> 28:26.446
I'm just saying, dude, like, that's not.

28:26.525 --> 28:27.207
That's not okay.

28:27.385 --> 28:28.706
No, it's cool for me to have to.

28:29.785 --> 28:30.546
You know what I'm saying?

28:30.725 --> 28:34.546
But I didn't, you know, I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.

28:34.625 --> 28:34.968
Exactly.

28:35.205 --> 28:36.926
You know, like, dude, fuck this guy.

28:37.025 --> 28:37.231
Yeah.

28:37.425 --> 28:40.726
No, I mean, well, so this is what started that whole chain of events, right?

28:40.745 --> 28:41.088
So you got.

28:41.065 --> 28:42.026
I hate this motherfucker.

28:42.105 --> 28:42.807
Oh, bro, I can't stand him.

28:42.785 --> 28:44.806
And I can't stand people standing up for him.

28:44.785 --> 28:47.166
It's so, it's stupid shit.

28:47.710 --> 28:54.790
But after he left the Oval Office, he decided to go back to Europe,

28:54.770 --> 28:56.931
and he did a little tour.

28:56.910 --> 28:58.011
Did you hear what he said today?

28:58.710 --> 29:00.691
About our kids?

29:00.690 --> 29:01.093
Our troops.

29:01.270 --> 29:01.932
You got that clip?

29:02.090 --> 29:02.792
I can put it in.

29:03.150 --> 29:05.451
Bro, this guy gets on television today.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.731
You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.

29:08.669 --> 29:10.190
This guy gets on TV today.

29:10.729 --> 29:11.510
Today is Monday.

29:11.809 --> 29:13.270
Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.

29:13.669 --> 29:22.329
And he fucking says, the United States is going to have to send its sons and daughters to fight in Ukraine, and they will die.

29:22.509 --> 29:25.189
That's what he said, his almost verbatim exact quote.

29:26.429 --> 29:34.089
Dude, if we send a single soldier over there, like a single fucking soldier, this administration is no different than any other one.

29:34.769 --> 29:35.171
Yeah.

29:35.309 --> 29:36.250
Yeah, 100%, man.

29:36.867 --> 29:40.687
But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour

29:40.667 --> 29:42.688
So he stopped to stop in the UK

29:43.087 --> 29:44.742
He went to the UK first.

29:45.105 --> 29:47.102
He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food.

29:47.122 --> 29:47.707
They got over there

29:49.107 --> 29:51.328
Gordon Ramsay's only one knows how to make food over there

29:53.727 --> 29:55.748
That's why he's so fucking famous, bro

29:56.387 --> 30:00.267
That's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's the only one over there who knows how to make food
