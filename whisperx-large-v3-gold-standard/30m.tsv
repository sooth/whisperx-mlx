3338	6159	Sleepin' on the floor, now my jewelry box froze.
6278	9459	Fuck a bowl, fuck a stove, counted millions in a cold.
9598	12779	Bad bitch, booted swole, got her own bankroll.
12918	16139	Can't fold, just a note, headshot, case closed.
16638	20079	What is up guys, it's Andy Frisella and this is the show for the real.
20118	23319	Let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness, and delusions of modern society.
23418	24699	Welcome to motherfuckin' reality.
24818	28899	Guys, today we have Andy and DJ!
29528	31249	Cruz the motherfucking internet.
31368	32110	That's what we're going to do.
32168	33469	That's what CTI stands for.
33528	34889	It stands for Cruz the internet.
36048	37849	I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.
38448	40709	But what we do here is we put topics on the screen.
40828	43029	We speculate on what's true and what's not true.
43608	48669	And then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems that all these knuckleheads create.
49828	51189	Let's just get right into it.
51808	53329	We don't run ads on the show.
55229	57050	So we ask that you don't be a hoe.
58129	59230	And you share the show.
59309	59711	There you go.
60069	60333	Yep.
60809	61990	You're looking good, man.
62149	62452	Is it?
62549	62932	Damn.
63229	63454	Yeah.
63829	66729	I saw you trying to start work out, and I know what the fuck you're up to.
66889	67550	What am I up to?
67729	69809	Trying to fucking catch up and beat me.
70289	71170	I can't let you.
72880	73542	I can't let you.
73860	75141	I can't.
75240	76381	Bro, you look good, man.
76420	76645	Shit.
77020	77542	You're looking good.
77560	79161	I don't know if it might just be the sweater.
79320	80581	I don't think it's the sweater, though.
80580	81302	No, it's my face.
81360	81862	Fuck, man.
82020	82642	Like, hey.
83000	83225	Yeah.
83340	83842	What's up?
84160	84802	You tell me.
84800	85721	You look good, too, bro.
85860	86362	Thanks, man.
86340	86882	Pull me down.
87020	87324	Yeah.
88540	90261	We had a big event this weekend.
90840	92401	Dude, that was a big historic event.
92620	92924	Right.
92900	92960	Yeah.
92960	93981	Yeah.
93960	94185	Yeah.
94160	94180	Yeah.
95898	98578	Big Jim turns 80 years old yesterday.
99278	99601	Shit.
99658	100759	We went to dinner on Saturday.
100858	101519	It was a good time.
101678	102100	It was good.
102218	103019	It was a good time, man.
102998	103739	It's always nice.
103938	104559	It's always nice.
104638	106558	He was kind of surprised.
107678	108978	You know, he's been around, man.
108978	110938	It's hard to get him.
111423	112923	I mean, he's been around that many blocks.
113103	113328	Yeah.
113463	116143	I mean, he fought in the Civil War.
118863	120463	He's seen it, thank you, too.
120563	121105	That's for sure.
121343	121530	Yeah.
121963	122844	80 years.
122923	123484	Fuck, man.
123603	124464	That's a long time.
124523	125484	Yeah, still moving, though.
125463	126983	We ought to get him on the show, maybe.
127723	128724	I mean, if you got-
128703	129584	Do an interview of his 80 years.
129643	133323	Yeah, if you guys are ready for a six-hour podcast, let us know.
133803	134544	That's the truth.
135443	136823	It's going to be an all-day affair.
138406	139047	What else going on?
139026	140067	It'll be fucking good, though, man.
140066	140291	Yeah.
140266	141627	Yeah, everything is good, man.
141966	143127	You know, everything is good.
143206	144607	We got a lot to talk about.
145046	145528	I bet.
145686	146029	Yeah.
146426	146988	I bet.
147346	148507	Let's do some cruising.
148726	149168	Let's do it.
149146	153806	Before we get to our headlines, you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce
153786	154387	in there for you.
155646	156887	We just landed on the moon.
158366	158948	Who did?
159306	159768	We did.
160426	161027	Me and you?
161166	162007	No, like America.
162246	162549	Oh.
162826	163090	Yep.
163246	163828	Lunar Lander.
164832	169387	Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon.
169407	170092	This is the first time
171332	173353	ever
175152	179572	How about say, you know, I was gonna say, you know, I would believe this when chicks can grow
179552	182532	You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage
182592	188152	You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah and be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real like
189892	190653	You just can't.
191232	197172	If you do, I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.
197212	197634	Bro.
197772	204792	Like, you just can't tell me that's real.
204832	205194	I'm sorry.
205172	207912	Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.
208132	208793	You know what I'm saying?
209032	210652	Well, apparently they can.
210712	212212	Well, one's more truer than the other, though.
214272	215872	Did you see that study I sent you?
216301	217642	Oh, yeah, dude, that's sad.
217641	225621	Bro, I sent DJ a study today, and they said that they ran some studies on people who actually transition.
225601	236101	So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they transition, they have a likelihood suicide rate of, I think, like 48%.
236081	238361	Right, and so doing the surgery saves their lives.
238361	240841	Yes, that's the justification for these people.
241021	243261	But now there's been a study that's come out.
243638	247659	A recent study published in Oxford's.
247638	248719	Yeah, well, you know Oxford.
248938	249819	They don't know what they're doing.
249858	250879	They trust science there.
251858	265279	Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.
265378	267299	So it goes from 48 to 96.
268298	269739	I ain't going mad.
271878	273139	Who's counting, man?
273118	273442	Yeah.
273625	276586	I would have never guessed.
276745	280826	I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis,
280925	282406	that eventually you're going to regret it.
282385	283146	You're going to have some problems.
283285	286406	I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts,
286445	288046	eventually you're going to regret it.
288125	293006	I would have never guessed if you sewed your vagina shut
292985	297566	and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis,
297685	298806	that I would regret that.
298925	300606	I mean, who would have known?
301265	302286	Who would have known?
303342	304004	I mean, I'm shocked.
304102	306463	Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.
307202	308283	First of all, it's a lot of cutting.
308782	310263	All right, but second of all.
310442	312323	Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.
312322	312665	Bullshit.
312762	313324	No, bullshit.
313342	313784	Yeah, bro.
314082	314122	Bullshit.
314342	314646	Yeah.
314822	315304	What do you mean?
315382	316163	What did I miss?
316282	317623	Wait, what did she say?
318242	318844	What'd she say?
318942	319345	I don't know.
319422	320084	She said something.
320202	320923	I can't say it.
320962	322143	I'll call her ass right now.
322242	322467	Yeah.
322664	333484	um no i mean but it makes sense bro you can't just do that man like and here's the thing
333464	339084	it's common sense bro it is but here's the thing this is a relatively new thing in our society and
339064	344124	the problem is is that they were able to spout all of these justifications there wasn't enough
344104	348204	time for these type of studies to even come through you got to follow that out you
348184	351244	know what i'm saying it takes some time to get a good base of evidence there
351790	353591	And, yeah, so, I mean, it makes sense.
353670	356831	But, yeah, so, I mean, Chicks with Dicks is more possible than going to the moon, though.
356870	357154	Yeah.
357410	357674	Yeah.
358710	362671	The funniest thing about this, though, real quick, so, you know, Buzz Aldrin?
363210	363474	Yeah.
363450	364311	I didn't know he was still alive.
364390	364912	He's still alive.
364910	365174	Is he?
365790	370491	And they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time.
372470	375131	It reports lunar gravity, and it is stable.
376950	377552	Come on.
377610	378352	That's fake, too.
380174	381255	Alcon, she mentioned her.
381354	382315	Looks better than any of you.
382874	383555	Y'all suck land.
383754	384114	We're out of here.
385734	386117	Okay.
393094	395154	He's like, shit, so that's what it really looks like.
396814	398135	Here's a picture they supplied.
398254	399175	This is supposed to be.
399254	399895	Who took the picture?
402874	403496	I don't know.
404334	404579	Yeah.
406246	410826	Anyway, we all know the government's liars, and we all know NASA's liars,
410846	415366	and we all know it's a massive money laundering scheme, just like all the other shit.
415826	419006	How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA
418986	423946	and then filtered back through different SPFs and perks and donations and funding?
424201	428821	Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do, like, any real, like, you know, crazy shit.
428901	431821	Like, you know, like, if they fuck with, like, any aliens or something.
431921	432321	You know what I'm saying?
432361	433422	Like, that maybe is the front.
433541	434702	Like, it's a front for something.
435281	436462	I'm a firm believer that.
436441	437922	I just said what it was a front for.
437961	439681	It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.
439961	446861	Yeah, but, like, I think originally, like, the whole reason we even did that was to, like, fucking, you know, funnel the money to cover up the fucking Cold War and shit.
446841	447263	You know?
447321	447501	I don't know.
447877	449377	Beat the Russians, you know.
449737	452317	Well, that was the original motivation.
453077	454257	But nobody went.
454717	455119	That's right.
455177	456217	Nobody fucking went, bro.
456317	460417	They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.
460397	462397	I mean, that's what that was about.
462377	463417	That was the basis of it, yeah.
463577	464657	Race to the moon.
464837	465160	Yep.
465757	466338	We'll beat you.
468177	470097	Out here in Arizona, you might as well stop.
472227	472709	Yeah, man.
472747	473828	It is what it is, man.
473867	476248	But guys, hope you're ready for a show.
476827	481767	Remember, if you wanted to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to andyfussella.com.
481767	482968	You want to make people real mad?
483187	483432	What?
483607	485408	You tell them that the earth isn't flat.
485767	486449	Oh, fuck.
486527	487308	Now, hold on.
487287	487829	Now, you listen.
488147	490308	The flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.
490287	490789	No, listen.
490947	492588	I mean, there's an argument.
492927	493569	No, there's not.
493667	494688	There's an argument, bro.
495227	496068	We've been up in planes.
496107	496789	What does it look like?
501674	502895	You've seen what I've seen.
504694	505835	I'm just saying, bro.
506074	506735	40,000 feet up.
506714	508015	You motherfuckers think the Earth's flat?
509034	509695	Joe does.
510034	511135	Joe Young does.
511194	512295	I know Joe Young does.
512334	512657	Yeah, bro.
512674	513475	We're ice shelfers.
514474	516115	I think ice shelf could be true.
516214	516401	No.
517154	519015	If that's true, then the Earth's flat.
519254	519796	I think...
519774	520915	No.
521474	521916	Yeah.
522094	522536	No.
522914	525214	Ice shelf theory is not about flat Earth.
526278	526740	It's about-
526718	527579	No, I'm not saying it is.
527618	530038	I'm saying if that is true, though, then it would have to be true.
530018	532118	No, there's still going to be some curvature.
532558	533359	It's like a fishbowl.
533518	537138	No, it's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head.
538298	538899	Like you.
539278	540878	If you just drew a little circle on your hat.
540918	543938	You wore one of them little hats, you know, those little tiny ones on your head.
544138	546418	The pointy ones or the-
546398	547319	No, the little ones.
547938	549758	You know, those little round hats.
553717	554558	A condom, Andy?
554597	555278	What are you talking about?
555477	558117	Like, what kind of hat on my head?
559137	559818	You know.
559877	560239	All right.
561577	561999	Anyway.
562177	562718	Yeah, man.
562757	563418	Hey, listen.
563817	564777	Go to Andy.com.
564997	565165	Yeah.
565217	566537	Go to AndyFacella.com.
567200	568800	I wonder where it takes you to andy.com.
569240	570161	Is that a real thing?
571140	572600	Let's get into our headlines, man.
572620	574080	We got some interesting stuff.
574160	577160	Let's start with first series of headlines.
577260	578021	Headline number one.
578480	579680	I wanted to get into this,
579800	582580	and this may be some foreshadowing going on.
582620	584380	I don't know, but I saw it,
584380	587240	and I immediately felt that this is not good.
587635	588281	So J.D.
588342	592216	Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.
593255	600355	And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.
600435	600699	Right.
600715	602296	Like that's a typical security thing.
602275	602618	Right.
603135	605816	I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.
605795	608036	We post it after on the fucking plane ride home.
608115	608595	You know what I'm saying?
608695	609836	Like that's a typical thing.
609855	610100	Right.
610675	611582	And so J.D.
611602	616115	Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.
616762	621162	And before he even got there, don't know if you guys saw this.
621222	627822	There was some some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.
628662	629372	All right.
629392	631462	Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?
631802	635502	Well, if you got I mean, first of all, people don't understand.
636387	645447	The level of logistics that has to go into organizing even a couple of hundred people together at the same time to get them into a specific location ahead of time.
646027	649767	This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail that needs to be removed.
650798	651899	There's no way.
652558	655619	That's not, like, how would they know that information ahead of time?
655918	658079	To even organize 500 fucking people to get there.
658058	661859	Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.
661838	662879	Leaking that shit out, bro.
663298	665499	And like I said, it wasn't a couple, bro.
665518	666659	It was a shit ton of them.
666838	667025	Yeah.
667418	668240	Vance is a traitor.
668338	669219	Go ski in Russia.
670278	673179	Vance equals Putin's pawn equals traitor.
673618	674699	So, dude, these people.
675790	678607	think that Putin is the problem.
678949	682730	All the while people are being arrested for making social
682710	684382	media posts all through Europe.
684986	685227	Okay.
685248	688610	We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women
688590	691791	and stabbing people and killing them who aren't European.
692834	693118	Okay?
693274	697174	We have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.
697894	698178	Okay?
698254	703214	And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already happening?
703314	704075	Going on around them.
704274	704597	Yeah, right.
704614	706854	Like, what are you guys fighting for?
708014	708397	You know?
710374	714454	These people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the media,
714434	719134	and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.
719885	720246	All right.
720387	721612	And dude, did you see that?
722516	729065	That comment I got from I told I did I show you that comment I got from one of the people who follows me about the Ukraine shit.
729045	729868	Yeah.
729928	732416	He's like Ukraine's a sovereign nation.
732517	740705	And, you know, we as the most powerful country in the world have a responsibility to stick up for countries that can't defend themselves.
740785	742352	Well, let me stop you right there, homie.
742739	743065	No, we don't.
743763	747183	We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.
747383	752803	And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.
752783	757843	It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.
758443	763943	OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.
765650	768690	An actual war because of our involvement with NATO.
768930	770650	They're sending troops in.
770970	782510	They would rather blow up the entire world than to have the truth about the entire fucking system that oppresses citizens globally to come out and how they do it.
782570	782972	Yeah, right.
783470	783714	Right.
783690	786870	But they're supposed to be the people of peace and love and tolerance.
787190	788450	And here we are.
788470	789151	It's insane, dude.
789430	790311	World War III on the doorstep.
790370	790575	Yeah.
790750	791591	For what reason?
791810	792471	For what reason?
793410	794031	What reason?
794962	799282	The only reason that these people all want this war, I'm not talking about these morons.
799542	803362	I'm talking about the people who are actually making the decisions.
803342	804203	Who write the shit on paper.
804282	807662	Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.
808162	815762	The only reason they want to do that is because they don't want the truth to come out about how all these nations collaborate to oppress the citizens of humanity.
816002	816170	Yep.
816882	818023	Yep, 100%, man.
818062	821062	Like I said, I saw this, and I'm just foreshadowing, bro.
821062	822243	This is some dangerous shit.
823802	826163	And they definitely need to lock that shit in.
826282	826702	You know what I'm saying?
826742	831902	Because we've seen what happens when you have leaks in your security team twice now with Donald Trump.
832362	832984	I mean, fuck.
833142	833444	J.D.
833465	838502	Vance obviously being an incumbent potential running candidate for 2028.
838482	841283	I mean, bro, like, I mean, it'd be a good way to get him out beforehand.
841542	842903	They got somebody fucking in this team.
843002	843624	I'm telling you right now.
843602	844483	A hundred percent, dude.
844462	845403	There's no doubt.
845570	846491	They need to watch it.
846570	850630	Listen, this administration is still full with rats.
851250	855190	It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.
855430	857970	You know, it's still full of this.
858050	858218	Yeah.
858479	858761	Yeah.
859366	863739	Well, so what kicked off all of this Putin nonsense?
863719	871139	We got to go back a couple of days to this meeting that happened with Trump, Vance, and Zelensky of Ukraine.
872459	878519	Now, I will say this, because we got plenty of criticism to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.
878639	879860	Look what these people call him, dude.
880019	883299	Protester held sign labeling Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.
883459	883646	Yeah.
883799	886179	You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.
886559	887400	You don't know it.
887559	894919	And you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with polarizing viewpoints.
894939	896300	It's the same thing they did with racism.
896279	897080	Yeah, dude.
897159	897581	Exactly.
897699	899340	And now people are like, well, you know what?
900683	901924	Black people do steal shit.
901943	902247	Yeah.
902543	903424	I mean, it's like, no.
904023	905484	Bro, that, no.
905603	906464	You know what?
906723	906948	No.
907023	913384	It's almost good that they do this because they devalue their defense mechanism.
913563	915264	Well, their offense mechanism, right?
915403	915523	Right.
915623	917084	Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.
917263	917431	Right.
917443	918924	Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.
919363	920624	And that shit ain't working anymore.
920663	921305	No one cares.
921283	921508	No.
921723	924304	And it just exposed how radical they are.
924463	924747	Yes.
924803	927044	And what the truth that they actually are trying to push behind.
927143	927586	Well, unfortunately.
927565	933445	also it brings a it brings to the surface the element that they claim to want to suppress
933425	940625	um you know when you call everybody racist for 20 fucking years eventually they're like yeah you
940605	945466	know what i am because i'm tired of getting called this and this and this from you fuckers fuck you
945445	951965	simply right yeah like dude and what happens is you you end up radical they end up radicalizing
951945	952447	people.
953570	955550	It works the opposite of what they want.
955650	959590	They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.
959730	960192	Normal people.
960170	962290	You know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.
962350	963910	That's not good for society.
964370	972570	Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that, you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.
972550	972893	Like.
973516	977076	I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.
977336	980896	And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that.
981136	986016	Because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks about their own race.
986496	990356	And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,
990336	993696	I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.
993796	996456	So I never made my race my identity.
996576	999496	I never said, yeah, I'm fucking proud to be white.
999556	1000897	That was never a thing.
1001613	1008173	I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says, dude, the content of their character, who they are, you know.
1008353	1010213	And I think most people are like that.
1010193	1012493	And I think we're getting to a point where.
1013223	1015503	You know, everybody's coming back to that,
1015543	1017663	and these people who are calling all the names
1017643	1018824	are going to be ostracized.
1018903	1020164	Like, nobody's listening to this shit.
1020583	1021684	We're fucking Nazi.
1022303	1024003	Bro, you don't even know what,
1024103	1026343	you don't even know anything about the history
1026323	1027663	of fucking Nazi movement.
1028103	1030583	You don't know anything of the history of World War I
1030563	1033503	or World War II or how the Federal Reserve was formed.
1033483	1036263	You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
1036443	1036945	Period.
1038367	1038968	That's just it.
1038967	1039468	No, it's stupid.
1039447	1040168	They don't know.
1040507	1043347	And they use these fucking terms, dude.
1043387	1044387	And I'm going to tell you what, man.
1047307	1049127	I get called every name in the book now.
1049187	1049688	I don't care.
1050027	1050628	Yeah, I take it.
1050727	1051887	I mean, I like smile.
1052087	1053647	I wear them as badges of honor.
1053707	1056607	Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye's got a fucking swastika t-shirt?
1056767	1058427	Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.
1059173	1064314	And you guys can get mad about that all you want, but he's forcing you to pay attention.
1064933	1071614	And then when you look at the symbol and the history of a swastika, you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.
1071793	1076774	And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune and prosperity through human history.
1076913	1079334	And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.
1079613	1081534	Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?
1081921	1084561	Do you think he used that to represent evil?
1084901	1087801	In his mind, that's what he was fighting for.
1087781	1093201	Yeah, he was, in his mind, he was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.
1093281	1098161	And then since then, that symbol has been, you know, you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.
1098461	1101081	Well, bro, if you go to Eastern cultures, it's everywhere.
1101241	1102002	It's on the buildings.
1102121	1105361	It's, I mean, it's still, is that not true, Syed?
1105461	1105824	Yeah, sorry.
1106001	1106245	Yeah.
1106501	1107802	So, like.
1108870	1114210	You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.
1114370	1114557	No.
1115570	1117691	And it's like, and dude, let's pay attention.
1117790	1119911	Who are, let's, who are these people?
1120910	1121671	Who are they?
1121930	1123131	What race are they?
1123850	1124492	Oh, they're all white.
1124510	1125271	Oh, they're all white.
1125330	1127111	And what gender are they?
1127510	1128212	All women.
1128490	1129691	And what age are they?
1130318	1132979	I mean, they're bruncher age for sure.
1133078	1134299	And what are they wearing?
1134738	1139179	Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking $400 jackets.
1139778	1140082	Right, right.
1140798	1145399	Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably just got laid off from USAID.
1145578	1146439	Yeah, for sure.
1146418	1149279	Listen, this group of people.
1149877	1155737	is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because
1155717	1160937	they are so privileged they don't have any worries they live in upper middle class
1160917	1166777	areas and they drink champagne on sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and
1166757	1171257	because they don't have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to
1171237	1176057	seem virtuous and care stand up for the right thing the thing you go go actually go to
1176037	1176732	to Ukraine.
1176752	1177877	Go fight in fucking Ukraine.
1178057	1178998	I don't want to hear it, dude.
1179408	1180429	I don't give a fuck.
1180608	1181090	You know what?
1181128	1182189	I'm America first.
1182648	1183011	Period.
1183308	1187028	I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel, or anybody else.
1187448	1189188	Here first, then there.
1189168	1195308	And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.
1195508	1196509	Doesn't matter who it is.
1197028	1202048	And, by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.
1204332	1205493	Makes sense to me, man.
1205552	1207293	But guys, let's slow this down.
1207532	1211172	Let's talk about how we even got to having these protests.
1211252	1213193	You know why the United States funds all these countries?
1214152	1214853	Do you know why?
1214912	1215554	Because we have to.
1215712	1215957	No.
1216492	1217034	That's not why.
1218406	1221046	The United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.
1221886	1225726	They golden handcuffed these countries, okay?
1225946	1228026	So they either say, hey, we'll give you this aid,
1228046	1230126	but you can't make this and this and this and this and this
1230106	1231806	as part of the agreement, right?
1231846	1233666	Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.
1234126	1238066	Or they give them the money knowing that...
1237998	1242238	The United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation.
1242598	1243159	Any prosperity.
1243598	1246278	Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.
1246358	1247738	It's no different than a rich kid.
1248178	1248422	Okay?
1248438	1252558	You got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep giving him money, keep giving him money,
1252638	1254618	keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money.
1254598	1258258	Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?
1258438	1258588	No.
1258958	1261078	Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.
1261658	1261826	Okay?
1261878	1265618	If you keep foreign aiding a country, what I'm saying here is that...
1266500	1269040	We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally.
1269200	1269405	Yeah.
1269480	1270580	And it needs to fucking stop.
1270760	1271142	Yeah, bro.
1271140	1272181	Take them off the teat, bro.
1272180	1273560	Make them learn how to get the food themselves.
1274760	1276280	Get strong or get conquered.
1276440	1277760	I don't give a fuck.
1277960	1278721	I don't care.
1278940	1280040	I'm American, bro.
1280180	1281440	I care about us first.
1281620	1283200	Do I care about people in Europe?
1283320	1284401	Yeah, I got friends in Europe.
1284520	1285880	Do I care about people in Australia?
1286080	1286621	Yeah, I do.
1286940	1289560	Do I care about them more than us?
1289680	1290661	No, sorry, I don't.
1290700	1291361	I care about us.
1292099	1293380	Yeah, 100%, bro.
1294619	1296000	But yeah, let's slow this down.
1296039	1302279	Let's see where this all started, because we've got to go back a couple of days to a meeting that Trump, Vance, and Zelensky had at the White House.
1303059	1308319	And this was the first time we got to really see any type of negotiations, I guess, with the press corps being there.
1308535	1311156	which I believe was part of Trump's play.
1311355	1318715	I mean, obviously, because apparently word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind cameras.
1319035	1323456	And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see his true colors.
1323535	1324636	So let's check this clip out.
1325360	1328960	I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.
1329100	1330480	Yes, but if you are not strong...
1330460	1334040	Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office
1334020	1336040	and try to litigate this in front of the American media.
1336360	1340640	Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines
1340620	1342380	because you have manpower problems.
1342680	1346140	You should be thanking the President for trying to bring an end to this conflict.
1346120	1348880	Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?
1349103	1350383	I have been to...
1350363	1351084	Count once.
1351083	1354663	I've actually watched and seen the stories,
1354903	1356983	and I know what happens is you bring people,
1357283	1359643	you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.
1360123	1364143	Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?
1364143	1364704	We have problems.
1364683	1369183	And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America
1369163	1373463	and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?
1373463	1374783	A lot of questions.
1375043	1376124	Let's start from the beginning.
1376183	1376370	Sure.
1376423	1378123	First of all, during the war,
1378634	1385994	Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future
1386374	1388704	God bless you don't know that God bless you.
1388745	1389474	God bless you
1390394	1393143	Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother was a threat.
1393365	1394234	Hold on stop it
1395254	1397252	That was a fucking hundred percent.
1397272	1399694	That was a fucking threat a hundred percent
1400588	1402029	Fuck this little motherfucker.
1402668	1406509	Throw him in the fucking wood chipper right there, and the war ends.
1407048	1408809	Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.
1409408	1414569	This motherfucker wants the war because him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.
1414668	1415170	You get paid.
1415759	1416261	Get paid, bro.
1416239	1417220	That was a fucking...
1417199	1418660	Bro, you're sitting in the Oval Office.
1418639	1421519	What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is...
1421499	1421921	Immediately?
1422159	1422384	No.
1422499	1423600	I love how Trump's sitting.
1423639	1424460	He's letting him talk.
1424499	1424724	Yeah.
1424859	1425461	Let's him talk.
1425519	1426041	Let's him talk.
1426079	1426561	Let's him talk.
1426619	1427141	Let's him talk.
1427679	1431699	The guy gets one inch out of line, and he said, hold on.
1432299	1433380	And then let's play the rest.
1433359	1434440	It fucking hammers him, bro.
1434499	1435800	Tell us what we're going to feel.
1435839	1436760	I'm not telling you.
1436739	1438760	Because you're in no position to dictate that.
1438879	1439520	Remember this.
1439639	1439979	I'm not telling you.
1439979	1443939	You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.
1444463	1446789	We're going to feel very good.
1446829	1450257	We're going to feel very good and very strong.
1450337	1452321	You're right now not in a very good position.
1452843	1457373	You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about it.
1458075	1460139	You're not in a good position.
1460340	1462004	You don't have the cards right now.
1462300	1463721	With us, you start having cards.
1463700	1464322	I'm not playing cards.
1464300	1466061	Right now, you're playing cards.
1466040	1466722	I'm very serious, Mr. President.
1466720	1467202	You're playing cards.
1467180	1467842	I'm very serious.
1467820	1470481	You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.
1470640	1472901	You're gambling with World War III.
1473220	1475801	You're gambling with World War III.
1476420	1481141	And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.
1481420	1482721	It's back to you.
1482700	1483000	I'm with all respect to you.
1483000	1485821	Far more than a lot of people said they should have.
1485820	1487021	Have you said thank you once?
1487275	1488436	A lot of times.
1488555	1489716	Even today.
1491135	1494756	You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.
1495235	1498576	Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America
1498555	1502316	and the president who's trying to save your country.
1503635	1504496	And your life.
1505602	1506882	Look, dude, he's dead anyway.
1507162	1507943	They're going to kill this dude.
1508242	1510422	Listen, either side's going to do it.
1510462	1510983	Yeah, for sure.
1511002	1511643	He's getting killed.
1511762	1512722	This guy's fucking done.
1512862	1515702	They can't let that dude walk knowing what he knows, bro.
1515882	1516783	No, not only that.
1516882	1517563	No, he stole.
1517742	1518962	Dude, he knows where all the money went.
1518962	1520502	He knows exactly where it went.
1520762	1521222	You know what I'm saying?
1521282	1522302	They can't let that dude walk.
1522409	1523030	Yeah.
1523050	1524833	See, you know, we call it how we see it.
1525253	1530420	A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset.
1530481	1533745	I saw this like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American.
1533785	1538091	I'm so dis listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters.
1538452	1538812	Okay.
1538852	1539373	Real talk.
1539814	1541436	You've never had to fight for anything.
1541496	1543659	You've never had to negotiate for anything.
1544000	1549988	This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men.
1550449	1550649	Okay.
1551367	1554107	When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.
1554287	1555767	And that's what Trump does.
1555927	1559167	He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.
1559387	1561087	He just threatened our country, bro.
1561227	1561413	Dude.
1561627	1562847	And we got people in this country.
1562827	1563628	What are we going to feel?
1563767	1564031	Brother.
1564007	1564528	If we don't help?
1564607	1564757	Wait.
1564847	1565111	Brother.
1565307	1570547	First of all, we got people in this country that fucking are on his side.
1571313	1574553	Like, bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.
1575073	1575754	Go over there.
1576033	1576714	Go live in Europe.
1576953	1577754	Go live in Ukraine.
1577853	1578395	They'll take you.
1578913	1583433	And then they'll take you to the front lines like they're taking people with Down syndrome
1583413	1585633	to the front fucking lines.
1585893	1587094	Bro, I saw that clip.
1587233	1589273	All you motherfuckers talking all this shit.
1589333	1590813	You don't know what you're talking about, dude.
1591173	1592154	You have no idea.
1592213	1593434	You haven't been paying attention.
1593833	1595273	You're sucked into your own life.
1595253	1599113	You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.
1599815	1602355	And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.
1602795	1603396	You know what?
1604155	1608015	You weren't embarrassed when our country was run by a literal vegetable.
1607995	1610015	You weren't embarrassed when...
1611475	1615296	They stole all your money and closed your businesses and fucked with you.
1615595	1620536	You weren't embarrassed when our whole country is a laughingstock of the entire world
1620515	1625116	because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons running our country.
1625335	1626576	Trans titties on the front line.
1626555	1629736	Bro, we got trans generals and, you know, we got kids.
1629835	1631896	We're promoting kids cutting off their dick.
1631875	1633616	And everybody else in the world is like.
1634493	1639493	the fuck is going on in the u.s you weren't embarrassed about that shit but you're embarrassed
1639473	1646293	about this man and this other man who have finally said uh no you're not gonna fucking do this shit
1646273	1653713	here okay i actually thought in my opinion that was the coolest baddest ass gangster ass shit
1653693	1658753	that i've ever seen from either one of those guys for sure bro so uh if you don't like it
1658733	1661753	and that's embarrassing to you then maybe you should fucking move
1662168	1665208	Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.
1665548	1668768	And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls, okay?
1668808	1669949	I call it how I see it.
1669948	1671228	If he does good, he does good.
1671248	1672469	If he does bad, he does bad.
1672808	1673509	That's great.
1673948	1674529	That's not good.
1674568	1675030	That's great.
1675168	1675570	That's great.
1675708	1675972	Okay?
1676308	1678148	This motherfucker's stealing your money.
1678428	1681408	You guys are out here working, and that's the problem.
1681488	1683868	A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.
1683848	1684310	They're not working.
1684288	1684552	Right?
1684668	1688268	So they don't see that tax be taken out of their check.
1688248	1691288	and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.
1692020	1696660	Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugattis.
1697740	1698401	He's got two bugs?
1698560	1698843	Yeah.
1699120	1699443	Damn.
1700220	1700861	Are they cool, though?
1701560	1703240	I mean, have you seen a bad Bugatti?
1703300	1703841	Yeah, that's true.
1703940	1704382	That's fair.
1704625	1706446	I'm just saying, dude, like, that's not.
1706525	1707207	That's not okay.
1707385	1708706	No, it's cool for me to have to.
1709785	1710546	You know what I'm saying?
1710725	1714546	But I didn't, you know, I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.
1714625	1714968	Exactly.
1715205	1716926	You know, like, dude, fuck this guy.
1717025	1717231	Yeah.
1717425	1720726	No, I mean, well, so this is what started that whole chain of events, right?
1720745	1721088	So you got.
1721065	1722026	I hate this motherfucker.
1722105	1722807	Oh, bro, I can't stand him.
1722785	1724806	And I can't stand people standing up for him.
1724785	1727166	It's so, it's stupid shit.
1727710	1734790	But after he left the Oval Office, he decided to go back to Europe,
1734770	1736931	and he did a little tour.
1736910	1738011	Did you hear what he said today?
1738710	1740691	About our kids?
1740690	1741093	Our troops.
1741270	1741932	You got that clip?
1742090	1742792	I can put it in.
1743150	1745451	Bro, this guy gets on television today.
1745510	1747731	You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.
1748669	1750190	This guy gets on TV today.
1750729	1751510	Today is Monday.
1751809	1753270	Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.
1753669	1762329	And he fucking says, the United States is going to have to send its sons and daughters to fight in Ukraine, and they will die.
1762509	1765189	That's what he said, his almost verbatim exact quote.
1766429	1774089	Dude, if we send a single soldier over there, like a single fucking soldier, this administration is no different than any other one.
1774149	1774249	100%.
1774769	1775171	Yeah.
1775309	1776250	Yeah, 100%, man.
1776867	1780687	But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour
1780667	1782688	So he stopped to stop in the UK
1783087	1784742	He went to the UK first.
1785105	1787102	He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food.
1787122	1787707	They got over there
1789107	1791328	Gordon Ramsay's only one knows how to make food over there
1793727	1795748	That's why he's so fucking famous, bro
1796387	1800267	That's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's the only one over there who knows how to make food
