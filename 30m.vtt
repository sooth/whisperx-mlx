WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:06.138
Sleepin' on the floor, now my jewelry box froze.

00:06.278 --> 00:09.438
Fuck a bowl, fuck a stove, counted millions in a cold.

00:09.598 --> 00:12.758
Bad bitch, booted swole, got her own bankroll.

00:12.918 --> 00:16.118
Can't fold, just a note, headshot, case closed.

00:16.638 --> 00:20.058
What is up guys, it's Andy Frisella and this is the show for the real.

00:20.118 --> 00:23.298
Let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness, and delusions of modern society.

00:23.418 --> 00:24.678
Welcome to motherfuckin' reality.

00:24.818 --> 00:28.878
Guys, today we have Andy and DJ!

00:29.528 --> 00:31.228
Cruz the motherfucking internet.

00:31.368 --> 00:32.088
That's what we're going to do.

00:32.168 --> 00:33.448
That's what CTI stands for.

00:33.528 --> 00:34.868
It stands for Cruz the internet.

00:36.048 --> 00:37.828
I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.

00:38.448 --> 00:40.688
But what we do here is we put topics on the screen.

00:40.828 --> 00:43.008
We speculate on what's true and what's not true.

00:43.608 --> 00:48.648
And then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems that all these knuckleheads create.

00:49.828 --> 00:51.168
Let's just get right into it.

00:51.808 --> 00:53.308
We don't run ads on the show.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.029
So we ask that you don't be a hoe.

00:58.129 --> 00:59.209
And you share the show.

00:59.309 --> 00:59.689
There you go.

01:00.069 --> 01:00.309
Yep.

01:00.809 --> 01:01.969
You're looking good, man.

01:02.149 --> 01:02.429
Is it?

01:02.549 --> 01:02.909
Damn.

01:03.229 --> 01:03.429
Yeah.

01:03.829 --> 01:06.709
I saw you trying to start work out, and I know what the fuck you're up to.

01:06.889 --> 01:07.529
What am I up to?

01:07.729 --> 01:09.789
Trying to fucking catch up and beat me.

01:10.289 --> 01:11.149
I can't let you.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.520
I can't let you.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.120
I can't.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.360
Bro, you look good, man.

01:16.420 --> 01:16.620
Shit.

01:17.020 --> 01:17.520
You're looking good.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.140
I don't know if it might just be the sweater.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.560
I don't think it's the sweater, though.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.280
No, it's my face.

01:21.360 --> 01:21.840
Fuck, man.

01:22.020 --> 01:22.620
Like, hey.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.200
Yeah.

01:23.340 --> 01:23.820
What's up?

01:24.160 --> 01:24.780
You tell me.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.700
You look good, too, bro.

01:25.860 --> 01:26.340
Thanks, man.

01:26.340 --> 01:26.860
Pull me down.

01:27.020 --> 01:27.300
Yeah.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.240
We had a big event this weekend.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.380
Dude, that was a big historic event.

01:32.620 --> 01:32.900
Right.

01:32.900 --> 01:32.960
Yeah.

01:32.960 --> 01:33.960
Yeah.

01:35.898 --> 01:38.558
Big Jim turns 80 years old yesterday.

01:39.278 --> 01:39.578
Shit.

01:39.658 --> 01:40.738
We went to dinner on Saturday.

01:40.858 --> 01:41.498
It was a good time.

01:41.678 --> 01:42.078
It was good.

01:42.218 --> 01:42.998
It was a good time, man.

01:42.998 --> 01:43.718
It's always nice.

01:43.938 --> 01:44.538
It's always nice.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.538
He was kind of surprised.

01:47.678 --> 01:48.958
You know, he's been around, man.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.918
It's hard to get him.

01:51.423 --> 01:52.903
I mean, he's been around that many blocks.

01:53.103 --> 01:53.303
Yeah.

01:53.463 --> 01:56.123
I mean, he fought in the Civil War.

01:58.863 --> 02:00.443
He's seen it, thank you, too.

02:00.563 --> 02:01.083
That's for sure.

02:01.343 --> 02:01.503
Yeah.

02:01.963 --> 02:02.823
80 years.

02:02.923 --> 02:03.463
Fuck, man.

02:03.603 --> 02:04.443
That's a long time.

02:04.523 --> 02:05.463
Yeah, still moving, though.

02:05.463 --> 02:06.963
We ought to get him on the show, maybe.

02:07.723 --> 02:08.703
I mean, if you got-

02:08.703 --> 02:09.563
Do an interview of his 80 years.

02:09.643 --> 02:13.303
Yeah, if you guys are ready for a six-hour podcast, let us know.

02:13.803 --> 02:14.523
That's the truth.

02:15.443 --> 02:16.803
It's going to be an all-day affair.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.026
What else going on?

02:19.026 --> 02:20.046
It'll be fucking good, though, man.

02:20.066 --> 02:20.266
Yeah.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.606
Yeah, everything is good, man.

02:21.966 --> 02:23.106
You know, everything is good.

02:23.206 --> 02:24.586
We got a lot to talk about.

02:25.046 --> 02:25.506
I bet.

02:25.686 --> 02:26.006
Yeah.

02:26.426 --> 02:26.966
I bet.

02:27.346 --> 02:28.486
Let's do some cruising.

02:28.726 --> 02:29.146
Let's do it.

02:29.146 --> 02:33.786
Before we get to our headlines, you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce

02:33.786 --> 02:34.366
in there for you.

02:35.646 --> 02:36.866
We just landed on the moon.

02:38.366 --> 02:38.926
Who did?

02:39.306 --> 02:39.746
We did.

02:40.426 --> 02:41.006
Me and you?

02:41.166 --> 02:41.986
No, like America.

02:42.246 --> 02:42.526
Oh.

02:42.826 --> 02:43.066
Yep.

02:43.246 --> 02:43.806
Lunar Lander.

02:44.832 --> 02:50.072
Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon. This is first time

02:51.332 --> 02:53.332
ever

02:55.152 --> 02:59.552
How about say, you know, I was gonna say, you know, I would believe this when chicks can grow

02:59.552 --> 03:02.512
You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage

03:02.592 --> 03:08.132
You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah and be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real like

03:09.892 --> 03:10.632
You just can't.

03:11.232 --> 03:17.152
If you do, I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.

03:17.212 --> 03:17.612
Bro.

03:17.772 --> 03:24.772
Like, you just can't tell me that's real.

03:24.832 --> 03:25.172
I'm sorry.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.892
Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.

03:28.132 --> 03:28.772
You know what I'm saying?

03:29.032 --> 03:30.632
Well, apparently they can.

03:30.712 --> 03:32.192
Well, one's more truer than the other, though.

03:34.272 --> 03:35.852
Did you see that study I sent you?

03:36.301 --> 03:37.621
Oh, yeah, dude, that's sad.

03:37.641 --> 03:45.601
Bro, I sent DJ a study today, and they said that they ran some studies on people who actually transition.

03:45.601 --> 03:56.081
So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they transition, they have a likelihood suicide rate of, I think, like 48%.

03:56.081 --> 03:58.341
Right, and so doing the surgery saves their lives.

03:58.361 --> 04:00.821
Yes, that's the justification for these people.

04:01.021 --> 04:03.241
But now there's been a study that's come out.

04:03.638 --> 04:07.638
A recent study published in Oxford's.

04:07.638 --> 04:08.698
Yeah, well, you know Oxford.

04:08.938 --> 04:09.798
They don't know what they're doing.

04:09.858 --> 04:10.858
They trust science there.

04:11.858 --> 04:25.258
Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.

04:25.378 --> 04:27.278
So it goes from 48 to 96.

04:28.298 --> 04:29.718
I ain't going mad.

04:31.878 --> 04:33.118
Who's counting, man?

04:33.118 --> 04:33.418
Yeah.

04:33.625 --> 04:36.565
I would have never guessed.

04:36.745 --> 04:40.805
I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis,

04:40.925 --> 04:42.385
that eventually you're going to regret it.

04:42.385 --> 04:43.125
You're going to have some problems.

04:43.285 --> 04:46.385
I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts,

04:46.445 --> 04:48.025
eventually you're going to regret it.

04:48.125 --> 04:52.985
I would have never guessed if you sewed your vagina shut

04:52.985 --> 04:57.545
and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis,

04:57.685 --> 04:58.785
that I would regret that.

04:58.925 --> 05:00.585
I mean, who would have known?

05:01.265 --> 05:02.205
Who would have known?

05:03.342 --> 05:03.982
I mean, I'm shocked.

05:04.102 --> 05:06.442
Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.

05:07.202 --> 05:08.262
First of all, it's a lot of cutting.

05:08.782 --> 05:10.242
All right, but second of all.

05:10.442 --> 05:12.302
Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.

05:12.322 --> 05:12.642
Bullshit.

05:12.762 --> 05:13.302
No, bullshit.

05:13.342 --> 05:13.762
Yeah, bro.

05:14.082 --> 05:14.122
Bullshit.

05:14.342 --> 05:14.622
Yeah.

05:14.822 --> 05:15.282
What do you mean?

05:15.382 --> 05:16.142
What did I miss?

05:16.282 --> 05:17.602
Wait, what did she say?

05:18.242 --> 05:18.822
What'd she say?

05:18.942 --> 05:19.322
I don't know.

05:19.422 --> 05:20.062
She said something.

05:20.202 --> 05:20.902
I can't say it.

05:20.962 --> 05:22.122
I'll call her ass right now.

05:22.242 --> 05:22.442
Yeah.

05:22.664 --> 05:33.464
um no i mean but it makes sense bro you can't just do that man like and here's the thing

05:33.464 --> 05:39.064
it's common sense bro it is but here's the thing this is a relatively new thing in our society and

05:39.064 --> 05:44.104
the problem is is that they were able to spout all of these justifications there wasn't enough

05:44.104 --> 05:48.184
time for these type of studies to even come through you got to follow that out you

05:48.184 --> 05:51.224
know what i'm saying it takes some time to get a good base of evidence there

05:51.790 --> 05:53.570
And, yeah, so, I mean, it makes sense.

05:53.670 --> 05:56.810
But, yeah, so, I mean, Chicks with Dicks is more possible than going to the moon, though.

05:56.870 --> 05:57.130
Yeah.

05:57.410 --> 05:57.650
Yeah.

05:58.710 --> 06:02.650
The funniest thing about this, though, real quick, so, you know, Buzz Aldrin?

06:03.210 --> 06:03.450
Yeah.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.290
I didn't know he was still alive.

06:04.390 --> 06:04.890
He's still alive.

06:04.910 --> 06:05.150
Is he?

06:05.770 --> 06:10.470
And they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time.

06:12.250 --> 06:15.070
It reports lunar gravity, and it is stable.

06:17.050 --> 06:17.530
Come on.

06:17.590 --> 06:18.310
That's fake, too.

06:20.174 --> 06:21.254
Alcon, she mentioned here.

06:21.374 --> 06:22.314
Looks better than any of you.

06:22.874 --> 06:23.534
Y'all suck land.

06:23.754 --> 06:24.114
We're out of here.

06:25.694 --> 06:26.094
Okay.

06:33.094 --> 06:35.134
He's like, shit, so that's what it really looks like.

06:36.794 --> 06:38.134
Here's a picture they supplied.

06:38.274 --> 06:39.174
This is supposed to be.

06:39.254 --> 06:39.894
Who took the picture?

06:43.054 --> 06:43.494
I don't know.

06:44.354 --> 06:44.574
Yeah.

06:46.246 --> 06:50.806
Anyway, we all know the government's liars, and we all know NASA's liars,

06:50.846 --> 06:55.346
and we all know it's a massive money laundering scheme, just like all the other shit.

06:55.826 --> 06:58.986
How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA

06:58.986 --> 07:03.926
and then filtered back through different SPFs and perks and donations and funding?

07:04.201 --> 07:08.801
Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do, like, any real, like, you know, crazy shit.

07:08.901 --> 07:11.801
Like, you know, like, if they fuck with, like, any aliens or something.

07:11.921 --> 07:12.321
You know what I'm saying?

07:12.361 --> 07:13.401
Like, that maybe is the front.

07:13.541 --> 07:14.681
Like, it's a front for something.

07:15.281 --> 07:16.441
I'm a firm believer that.

07:16.441 --> 07:17.901
I just said what it was a front for.

07:17.961 --> 07:19.661
It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.

07:19.961 --> 07:26.841
Yeah, but, like, I think originally, like, the whole reason we even did that was to, like, fucking, you know, funnel the money to cover up the fucking Cold War and shit.

07:26.841 --> 07:27.241
You know?

07:27.321 --> 07:27.501
I don't know.

07:27.877 --> 07:29.357
Beat the Russians, you know.

07:29.737 --> 07:32.297
Well, that was the original motivation.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.237
But nobody went.

07:34.717 --> 07:35.097
That's right.

07:35.177 --> 07:36.197
Nobody fucking went, bro.

07:36.317 --> 07:40.397
They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.

07:40.397 --> 07:42.377
I mean, that's what that was about.

07:42.377 --> 07:43.397
That was the basis of it, yeah.

07:43.577 --> 07:44.637
Race to the moon.

07:44.837 --> 07:45.137
Yep.

07:45.757 --> 07:46.317
We'll beat you.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.077
Out here in Arizona, you might as well stop.

07:52.227 --> 07:52.687
Yeah, man.

07:52.747 --> 07:53.807
It is what it is, man.

07:53.867 --> 07:56.227
But guys, hope you're ready for a show.

07:56.827 --> 08:01.747
Remember, if you wanted to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to andyfussella.com.

08:01.767 --> 08:02.947
You want to make people real mad?

08:03.187 --> 08:03.407
What?

08:03.607 --> 08:05.387
You tell them that the earth isn't flat.

08:05.767 --> 08:06.427
Oh, fuck.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.287
Now, hold on.

08:07.287 --> 08:07.807
Now, you listen.

08:08.147 --> 08:10.287
The flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.

08:10.287 --> 08:10.767
No, listen.

08:10.947 --> 08:12.567
I mean, there's an argument.

08:12.927 --> 08:13.547
No, there's not.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.667
There's an argument, bro.

08:15.227 --> 08:16.047
We've been up in planes.

08:16.107 --> 08:16.767
What does it look like?

08:21.674 --> 08:22.874
You've seen what I've seen.

08:24.694 --> 08:25.814
I'm just saying, bro.

08:26.074 --> 08:26.714
40,000 feet up.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.994
You motherfuckers think the Earth's flat?

08:29.034 --> 08:29.674
Joe does.

08:30.034 --> 08:31.114
Joe Young does.

08:31.194 --> 08:32.274
I know Joe Young does.

08:32.334 --> 08:32.634
Yeah, bro.

08:32.674 --> 08:33.454
We're ice shelfers.

08:34.474 --> 08:36.094
I think ice shelf could be true.

08:36.214 --> 08:36.374
No.

08:37.154 --> 08:38.994
If that's true, then the Earth's flat.

08:39.254 --> 08:39.774
I think...

08:39.774 --> 08:40.894
No.

08:41.474 --> 08:41.894
Yeah.

08:42.094 --> 08:42.514
No.

08:42.914 --> 08:45.194
Ice shelf theory is not about flat Earth.

08:46.278 --> 08:46.718
It's about-

08:46.718 --> 08:47.558
No, I'm not saying it is.

08:47.618 --> 08:50.018
I'm saying if that is true, though, then it would have to be true.

08:50.018 --> 08:52.098
No, there's still going to be some curvature.

08:52.558 --> 08:53.338
It's like a fishbowl.

08:53.518 --> 08:57.118
No, it's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head.

08:58.298 --> 08:58.878
Like you.

08:59.278 --> 09:00.858
If you just drew a little circle on your hat.

09:00.918 --> 09:03.918
You wore one of them little hats, you know, those little tiny ones on your head.

09:04.138 --> 09:06.398
The pointy ones or the-

09:06.398 --> 09:07.298
No, the little ones.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.738
You know, those little round hats.

09:13.717 --> 09:14.537
A condom, Andy?

09:14.597 --> 09:15.257
What are you talking about?

09:15.477 --> 09:18.097
Like, what kind of hat on my head?

09:19.137 --> 09:19.797
You know.

09:19.877 --> 09:20.217
All right.

09:21.577 --> 09:21.977
Anyway.

09:22.177 --> 09:22.697
Yeah, man.

09:22.757 --> 09:23.397
Hey, listen.

09:23.817 --> 09:24.757
Go to Andy.com.

09:24.997 --> 09:25.137
Yeah.

09:25.217 --> 09:26.517
Go to AndyFacella.com.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.780
I wonder where it takes you to andy.com.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.140
Is that a real thing?

09:31.140 --> 09:32.580
Let's get into our headlines, man.

09:32.620 --> 09:34.060
We got some interesting stuff.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.140
Let's start with first series of headlines.

09:37.260 --> 09:38.000
Headline number one.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.660
I wanted to get into this,

09:39.800 --> 09:42.560
and this may be some foreshadowing going on.

09:42.620 --> 09:44.360
I don't know, but I saw it,

09:44.380 --> 09:47.220
and I immediately felt that this is not good.

09:47.635 --> 09:52.195
So J.D. Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.

09:53.255 --> 10:00.335
And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.

10:00.435 --> 10:00.675
Right.

10:00.715 --> 10:02.275
Like that's a typical security thing.

10:02.275 --> 10:02.595
Right.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.795
I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.

10:05.795 --> 10:08.015
We post it after on the fucking plane ride home.

10:08.115 --> 10:08.595
You know what I'm saying?

10:08.695 --> 10:09.815
Like that's a typical thing.

10:09.855 --> 10:10.075
Right.

10:10.675 --> 10:16.095
And so J.D. Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.

10:16.762 --> 10:21.142
And before he even got there, I don't know if you guys saw this.

10:21.282 --> 10:27.802
There was some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.

10:28.962 --> 10:29.262
All right.

10:29.342 --> 10:31.442
Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?

10:31.842 --> 10:35.482
Well, if you got I mean, first of all, people don't understand.

10:36.387 --> 10:45.427
The level of logistics that has to go into organizing even a couple of hundred people together at the same time to get them into a specific location ahead of time.

10:46.027 --> 10:49.747
This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail that needs to be removed.

10:50.798 --> 10:51.878
There's no way.

10:52.558 --> 10:55.598
That's not, like, how would they know that information ahead of time?

10:55.918 --> 10:58.058
To even organize 500 fucking people to get there.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.838
Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.

11:01.838 --> 11:02.858
Leaking that shit out, bro.

11:03.298 --> 11:05.478
And like I said, it wasn't a couple, bro.

11:05.518 --> 11:06.638
It was a shit ton of them.

11:06.838 --> 11:06.998
Yeah.

11:07.418 --> 11:08.218
Vance is a traitor.

11:08.338 --> 11:09.198
Go ski in Russia.

11:10.278 --> 11:13.158
Vance equals Putin's pawn equals traitor.

11:13.618 --> 11:14.678
So, dude, these people.

11:15.790 --> 11:22.990
think that Putin is the problem. All the while, people are being arrested for making social media

11:22.990 --> 11:28.850
posts all through Europe. Okay. We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women and

11:28.850 --> 11:31.770
stabbing people and killing them who aren't European.

11:32.834 --> 11:33.094
Okay?

11:33.274 --> 11:37.154
We have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.

11:37.894 --> 11:38.154
Okay?

11:38.254 --> 11:43.194
And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already happening?

11:43.314 --> 11:44.054
Going on around them.

11:44.274 --> 11:44.574
Yeah, right.

11:44.614 --> 11:46.834
Like, what are you guys fighting for?

11:48.014 --> 11:48.374
You know?

11:50.374 --> 11:54.434
These people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the media,

11:54.434 --> 11:59.114
and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.

11:59.885 --> 12:09.045
All right. And dude, did you see that? That comment I got from I told I did I show you that comment I got from one of the people who follows me about the Ukraine shit.

12:09.045 --> 12:20.685
Yeah. He's like Ukraine's a sovereign nation. And, you know, we as the most powerful country in the world have a responsibility to stick up for countries that can't defend themselves.

12:20.785 --> 12:23.045
Well, let me stop you right there, homie. No, we don't.

12:23.763 --> 12:27.163
We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.

12:27.383 --> 12:32.783
And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.

12:32.783 --> 12:37.823
It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.

12:38.443 --> 12:43.923
OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.

12:45.650 --> 12:48.670
An actual war because of our involvement with NATO.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.630
They're sending troops in.

12:50.970 --> 13:02.490
They would rather blow up the entire world than to have the truth about the entire fucking system that oppresses citizens globally to come out and how they do it.

13:02.570 --> 13:02.950
Yeah, right.

13:03.470 --> 13:03.690
Right.

13:03.690 --> 13:06.850
But they're supposed to be the people of peace and love and tolerance.

13:07.190 --> 13:08.430
And here we are.

13:08.470 --> 13:09.130
It's insane, dude.

13:09.430 --> 13:10.290
World War III on the doorstep.

13:10.370 --> 13:10.550
Yeah.

13:10.750 --> 13:11.570
For what reason?

13:11.810 --> 13:12.450
For what reason?

13:13.410 --> 13:14.010
What reason?

13:14.962 --> 13:19.262
The only reason that these people all want this war, I'm not talking about these morons.

13:19.542 --> 13:23.342
I'm talking about the people who are actually making the decisions.

13:23.342 --> 13:24.182
Who write the shit on paper.

13:24.282 --> 13:27.642
Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.

13:28.162 --> 13:35.742
The only reason they want to do that is because they don't want the truth to come out about how all these nations collaborate to oppress the citizens of humanity.

13:36.002 --> 13:36.142
Yep.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.002
Yep, 100%, man.

13:38.062 --> 13:41.042
Like I said, I saw this, and I'm just foreshadowing, bro.

13:41.062 --> 13:42.222
This is some dangerous shit.

13:43.802 --> 13:46.142
And they definitely need to lock that shit in.

13:46.282 --> 13:46.702
You know what I'm saying?

13:46.742 --> 13:51.882
Because we've seen what happens when you have leaks in your security team twice now with Donald Trump.

13:52.362 --> 13:52.962
I mean, fuck.

13:53.142 --> 13:58.482
J.D. Vance obviously being an incumbent potential running candidate for 2028.

13:58.482 --> 14:01.262
I mean, bro, like, I mean, it'd be a good way to get him out beforehand.

14:01.542 --> 14:02.882
They got somebody fucking in this team.

14:03.002 --> 14:03.602
I'm telling you right now.

14:03.602 --> 14:04.462
A hundred percent, dude.

14:04.462 --> 14:05.382
There's no doubt.

14:05.570 --> 14:06.470
They need to watch it.

14:06.570 --> 14:10.610
Listen, this administration is still full with rats.

14:11.250 --> 14:15.170
It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.

14:15.430 --> 14:17.950
You know, it's still full of this.

14:18.050 --> 14:18.190
Yeah.

14:18.479 --> 14:23.719
Yeah. Well, so what kicked off all of this Putin nonsense?

14:23.719 --> 14:31.119
We got to go back a couple of days to this meeting that happened with Trump, Vance, and Zelensky of Ukraine.

14:32.459 --> 14:38.499
Now, I will say this, because we got plenty of criticism to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.

14:38.639 --> 14:39.839
Look what these people call him, dude.

14:40.019 --> 14:43.279
Protester held sign labeling Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.

14:43.459 --> 14:43.619
Yeah.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.159
You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.

14:46.559 --> 14:47.379
You don't know it.

14:47.559 --> 14:54.899
And you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with polarizing viewpoints.

14:54.939 --> 14:56.279
It's the same thing they did with racism.

14:56.279 --> 14:57.059
Yeah, dude.

14:57.159 --> 14:57.559
Exactly.

14:57.699 --> 14:59.319
And now people are like, well, you know what?

15:00.683 --> 15:01.903
Black people do steal shit.

15:01.943 --> 15:02.223
Yeah.

15:02.543 --> 15:03.403
I mean, it's like, no.

15:04.023 --> 15:05.463
Bro, that, no.

15:05.603 --> 15:06.443
You know what?

15:06.723 --> 15:06.923
No.

15:07.023 --> 15:13.363
It's almost good that they do this because they devalue their defense mechanism.

15:13.563 --> 15:15.243
Well, their offense mechanism, right?

15:15.403 --> 15:15.523
Right.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.063
Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.

15:17.263 --> 15:17.403
Right.

15:17.443 --> 15:18.903
Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.

15:19.363 --> 15:20.603
And that shit ain't working anymore.

15:20.663 --> 15:21.283
No one cares.

15:21.283 --> 15:21.483
No.

15:21.723 --> 15:24.283
And it just exposed how radical they are.

15:24.463 --> 15:24.723
Yes.

15:24.803 --> 15:27.023
And what the truth that they actually are trying to push behind.

15:27.143 --> 15:27.563
Well, unfortunately.

15:27.565 --> 15:33.425
also it brings a it brings to the surface the element that they claim to want to suppress

15:33.425 --> 15:40.605
um you know when you call everybody racist for 20 fucking years eventually they're like yeah you

15:40.605 --> 15:45.445
know what i am because i'm tired of getting called this and this and this from you fuckers fuck you

15:45.445 --> 15:51.945
simply right yeah like dude and what happens is you you end up radical they end up radicalizing

15:51.945 --> 15:52.425
people.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.530
It works the opposite of what they want.

15:55.650 --> 15:59.570
They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.

15:59.730 --> 16:00.170
Normal people.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.270
You know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.

16:02.350 --> 16:03.890
That's not good for society.

16:04.370 --> 16:12.550
Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that, you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.

16:12.550 --> 16:12.870
Like.

16:13.516 --> 16:17.056
I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.

16:17.336 --> 16:20.876
And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that.

16:21.136 --> 16:25.996
Because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks about their own race.

16:26.496 --> 16:30.336
And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,

16:30.336 --> 16:33.676
I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.

16:33.796 --> 16:36.436
So I never made my race my identity.

16:36.576 --> 16:39.476
I never said, yeah, I'm fucking proud to be white.

16:39.556 --> 16:40.876
That was never a thing.

16:41.613 --> 16:48.153
I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says, dude, the content of their character, who they are, you know.

16:48.353 --> 16:50.193
And I think most people are like that.

16:50.193 --> 16:52.473
And I think we're getting to a point where.

16:53.223 --> 16:55.483
You know, everybody's coming back to that,

16:55.543 --> 16:57.643
and these people who are calling all the names

16:57.643 --> 16:58.803
are going to be ostracized.

16:58.903 --> 17:00.143
Like, nobody's listening to this shit.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.663
We're fucking Nazi.

17:02.303 --> 17:03.983
Bro, you don't even know what,

17:04.103 --> 17:06.323
you don't even know anything about the history

17:06.323 --> 17:07.643
of fucking Nazi movement.

17:08.103 --> 17:10.563
You don't know anything of the history of World War I

17:10.563 --> 17:13.483
or World War II or how the Federal Reserve was formed.

17:13.483 --> 17:16.243
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

17:16.443 --> 17:16.923
Period.

17:18.367 --> 17:18.947
That's just it.

17:18.967 --> 17:19.447
No, it's stupid.

17:19.447 --> 17:20.147
They don't know.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.327
And they use these fucking terms, dude.

17:23.387 --> 17:24.367
And I'm going to tell you what, man.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.107
I get called every name in the book now.

17:29.187 --> 17:29.667
I don't care.

17:30.027 --> 17:30.607
Yeah, I take it.

17:30.727 --> 17:31.867
I mean, I like smile.

17:32.087 --> 17:33.627
I wear them as badges of honor.

17:33.707 --> 17:36.587
Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye's got a fucking swastika t-shirt?

17:36.767 --> 17:38.407
Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.

17:39.173 --> 17:44.293
And you guys can get mad about that all you want, but he's forcing you to pay attention.

17:44.933 --> 17:51.593
And then when you look at the symbol and the history of a swastika, you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.

17:51.793 --> 17:56.753
And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune and prosperity through human history.

17:56.913 --> 17:59.313
And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.513
Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?

18:01.921 --> 18:04.541
Do you think he used that to represent evil?

18:04.901 --> 18:07.781
In his mind, that's what he was fighting for.

18:07.781 --> 18:13.181
Yeah, he was, in his mind, he was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.

18:13.281 --> 18:18.141
And then since then, that symbol has been, you know, you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.

18:18.461 --> 18:21.061
Well, bro, if you go to Eastern cultures, it's everywhere.

18:21.241 --> 18:21.981
It's on the buildings.

18:22.121 --> 18:25.341
It's, I mean, it's still, is that not true, Syed?

18:25.461 --> 18:25.801
Yeah, sorry.

18:26.001 --> 18:26.221
Yeah.

18:26.501 --> 18:27.781
So, like.

18:28.870 --> 18:34.190
You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.

18:34.370 --> 18:34.530
No.

18:35.570 --> 18:37.670
And it's like, and dude, let's pay attention.

18:37.790 --> 18:39.890
Who are, let's, who are these people?

18:40.910 --> 18:41.650
Who are they?

18:41.930 --> 18:43.110
What race are they?

18:43.850 --> 18:44.470
Oh, they're all white.

18:44.510 --> 18:45.250
Oh, they're all white.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.090
And what gender are they?

18:47.510 --> 18:48.190
All women.

18:48.490 --> 18:49.670
And what age are they?

18:50.318 --> 18:52.958
I mean, they're bruncher age for sure.

18:53.078 --> 18:54.278
And what are they wearing?

18:54.738 --> 18:59.158
Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking $400 jackets.

18:59.778 --> 19:00.058
Right, right.

19:00.798 --> 19:05.378
Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably just got laid off from USAID.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.418
Yeah, for sure.

19:06.418 --> 19:09.258
Listen, this group of people.

19:09.877 --> 19:15.717
is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because

19:15.717 --> 19:20.917
they are so privileged they don't have any worries they live in upper middle class

19:20.917 --> 19:26.757
areas and they drink champagne on sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and

19:26.757 --> 19:31.237
because they don't have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to

19:31.237 --> 19:36.037
seem virtuous and care stand up for the right thing the thing you go go actually go to

19:36.037 --> 19:37.857
to Ukraine. Go fight in fucking Ukraine.

19:38.057 --> 19:38.977
I don't want to hear it, dude.

19:39.408 --> 19:40.408
I don't give a fuck.

19:40.608 --> 19:41.068
You know what?

19:41.128 --> 19:42.168
I'm America first.

19:42.648 --> 19:42.988
Period.

19:43.308 --> 19:47.008
I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel, or anybody else.

19:47.448 --> 19:49.168
Here first, then there.

19:49.168 --> 19:55.288
And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.

19:55.508 --> 19:56.488
Doesn't matter who it is.

19:57.028 --> 20:02.028
And, by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.

20:04.332 --> 20:05.472
Makes sense to me, man.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.272
But guys, let's slow this down.

20:07.532 --> 20:11.152
Let's talk about how we even got to having these protests.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.172
You know why the United States funds all these countries?

20:14.152 --> 20:14.832
Do you know why?

20:14.912 --> 20:15.532
Because we have to.

20:15.712 --> 20:15.932
No.

20:16.492 --> 20:17.012
That's not why.

20:18.406 --> 20:21.026
The United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.

20:21.886 --> 20:25.706
They golden handcuffed these countries, okay?

20:25.946 --> 20:28.006
So they either say, hey, we'll give you this aid,

20:28.046 --> 20:30.106
but you can't make this and this and this and this and this

20:30.106 --> 20:31.786
as part of the agreement, right?

20:31.846 --> 20:33.646
Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.

20:34.126 --> 20:38.046
Or they give them the money knowing that...

20:37.998 --> 20:42.218
The United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation.

20:42.598 --> 20:43.138
Any prosperity.

20:43.598 --> 20:46.258
Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.

20:46.358 --> 20:47.718
It's no different than a rich kid.

20:48.178 --> 20:48.398
Okay?

20:48.438 --> 20:52.538
You got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep giving him money, keep giving him money,

20:52.638 --> 20:54.598
keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money.

20:54.598 --> 20:58.238
Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?

20:58.438 --> 20:58.558
No.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.058
Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.

21:01.658 --> 21:01.798
Okay?

21:01.878 --> 21:05.598
If you keep foreign aiding a country, what I'm saying here is that...

21:06.500 --> 21:09.020
We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally.

21:09.200 --> 21:09.380
Yeah.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.560
And it needs to fucking stop.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.120
Yeah, bro.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.160
Take them off the teat, bro.

21:12.180 --> 21:13.540
Make them learn how to get the food themselves.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.260
Get strong or get conquered.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.740
I don't give a fuck.

21:17.960 --> 21:18.700
I don't care.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.020
I'm American, bro.

21:20.180 --> 21:21.420
I care about us first.

21:21.620 --> 21:23.180
Do I care about people in Europe?

21:23.320 --> 21:24.380
Yeah, I got friends in Europe.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.860
Do I care about people in Australia?

21:26.080 --> 21:26.600
Yeah, I do.

21:26.940 --> 21:29.540
Do I care about them more than us?

21:29.680 --> 21:30.640
No, sorry, I don't.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.340
I care about us.

21:32.099 --> 21:33.359
Yeah, 100%, bro.

21:34.619 --> 21:35.979
But yeah, let's slow this down.

21:36.039 --> 21:42.259
Let's see where this all started, because we've got to go back a couple of days to a meeting that Trump, Vance, and Zelensky had at the White House.

21:43.059 --> 21:48.299
And this was the first time we got to really see any type of negotiations, I guess, with the press corps being there.

21:48.535 --> 21:51.135
which I believe was part of Trump's play.

21:51.355 --> 21:58.695
I mean, obviously, because apparently word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind cameras.

21:59.035 --> 22:03.435
And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see his true colors.

22:03.535 --> 22:04.615
So let's check this clip out.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.940
I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.460
Yes, but if you are not strong...

22:10.460 --> 22:14.020
Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office

22:14.020 --> 22:16.020
and try to litigate this in front of the American media.

22:16.360 --> 22:20.620
Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines

22:20.620 --> 22:22.360
because you have manpower problems.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.120
You should be thanking the President to bring an end to this conflict.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.860
Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?

22:29.103 --> 22:30.363
I have been to...

22:30.363 --> 22:31.063
Count once.

22:31.083 --> 22:34.643
I've actually watched and seen the stories,

22:34.903 --> 22:36.963
and I know what happens is you bring people,

22:37.283 --> 22:39.623
you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.

22:40.123 --> 22:44.123
Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?

22:44.163 --> 22:44.683
We have problems.

22:44.683 --> 22:49.163
And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America

22:49.163 --> 22:53.443
and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?

22:53.463 --> 22:54.763
A lot of questions.

22:55.043 --> 22:56.103
Let's start from the beginning.

22:56.163 --> 22:56.343
Sure.

22:56.423 --> 22:58.103
First of all, during the war,

22:58.634 --> 23:05.974
Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future

23:06.374 --> 23:09.454
God bless you don't know that God bless you. God bless you

23:10.394 --> 23:14.214
Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother was a threat. Hold on stop it

23:15.254 --> 23:19.674
That was a fucking hundred percent. That was a fucking threat a hundred percent

23:20.588 --> 23:22.008
Fuck this little motherfucker.

23:22.668 --> 23:26.488
Throw him in the fucking wood chipper right there, and the war ends.

23:27.048 --> 23:28.788
Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.

23:29.408 --> 23:34.548
This motherfucker wants the war because him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.

23:34.668 --> 23:35.148
You get paid.

23:35.759 --> 23:36.239
Get paid, bro.

23:36.239 --> 23:37.199
That was a fucking...

23:37.199 --> 23:38.639
Bro, you're sitting in the Oval Office.

23:38.639 --> 23:41.499
What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is...

23:41.499 --> 23:41.899
Immediately?

23:42.159 --> 23:42.359
No.

23:42.499 --> 23:43.579
I love how Trump's sitting.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.439
He's letting him talk.

23:44.499 --> 23:44.699
Yeah.

23:44.859 --> 23:45.439
Let's him talk.

23:45.519 --> 23:46.019
Let's him talk.

23:46.079 --> 23:46.539
Let's him talk.

23:46.619 --> 23:47.119
Let's him talk.

23:47.679 --> 23:51.679
The guy gets one inch out of line, and he said, hold on.

23:52.299 --> 23:53.359
And then let's play the rest.

23:53.359 --> 23:54.419
It fucking hammers him, bro.

23:54.499 --> 23:55.779
Tell us what we're going to feel.

23:55.839 --> 23:56.739
I'm not telling you.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.739
Because you're in no position to dictate that.

23:58.879 --> 23:59.499
Remember this.

23:59.639 --> 23:59.979
I'm not telling you.

23:59.979 --> 24:03.919
You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

24:04.463 --> 24:21.983
We're going to feel very good. We're going to feel very good and very strong. You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about it. You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.700
With us, you start having cards.

24:23.700 --> 24:24.300
I'm not playing cards.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.040
Right now, you're playing cards.

24:26.040 --> 24:26.700
I'm very serious, Mr. President.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.180
You're playing cards.

24:27.180 --> 24:27.820
I'm very serious.

24:27.820 --> 24:30.460
You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.880
You're gambling with World War III.

24:33.220 --> 24:35.780
You're gambling with World War III.

24:36.420 --> 24:41.120
And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.

24:41.420 --> 24:42.700
It's back to you.

24:42.700 --> 24:43.000
I'm with all respect to you.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.800
Far more than a lot of people said they should have.

24:45.820 --> 24:47.000
Have you said thank you once?

24:47.275 --> 24:48.415
A lot of times.

24:48.555 --> 24:49.695
Even today.

24:51.135 --> 24:54.735
You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.

24:55.235 --> 24:58.555
Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America

24:58.555 --> 25:02.295
and the president who's trying to save your country.

25:03.635 --> 25:04.475
And your life.

25:05.602 --> 25:06.862
Look, dude, he's dead anyway.

25:07.162 --> 25:07.922
They're going to kill this dude.

25:08.242 --> 25:10.402
Listen, either side's going to do it.

25:10.462 --> 25:10.962
Yeah, for sure.

25:11.002 --> 25:11.622
He's getting killed.

25:11.762 --> 25:12.702
This guy's fucking done.

25:12.862 --> 25:15.682
They can't let that dude walk knowing what he knows, bro.

25:15.882 --> 25:16.762
No, not only that.

25:16.882 --> 25:17.542
No, he stole.

25:17.742 --> 25:18.942
Dude, he knows where all the money went.

25:18.962 --> 25:20.482
He knows exactly where it went.

25:20.762 --> 25:21.222
You know what I'm saying?

25:21.282 --> 25:22.282
They can't let that dude walk.

25:22.409 --> 25:50.629
Yeah. See, you know, we call it how we see it. A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset. I saw this like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American. I'm so dis listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters. Okay. Real talk. You've never had to fight for anything. You've never had to negotiate for anything. This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men. Okay.

25:51.367 --> 25:54.087
When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.747
And that's what Trump does.

25:55.927 --> 25:59.147
He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.

25:59.387 --> 26:01.067
He just threatened our country, bro.

26:01.227 --> 26:01.387
Dude.

26:01.627 --> 26:02.827
And we got people in this country.

26:02.827 --> 26:03.607
What are we going to feel?

26:03.767 --> 26:04.007
Brother.

26:04.007 --> 26:04.507
If we don't help?

26:04.607 --> 26:04.727
Wait.

26:04.847 --> 26:05.087
Brother.

26:05.307 --> 26:10.527
First of all, we got people in this country that fucking are on his side.

26:11.313 --> 26:14.533
Like, bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.

26:15.073 --> 26:15.733
Go over there.

26:16.033 --> 26:16.693
Go live in Europe.

26:16.953 --> 26:17.733
Go live in Ukraine.

26:17.853 --> 26:18.373
They'll take you.

26:18.913 --> 26:23.413
And then they'll take you to the front lines like they're taking people with Down syndrome

26:23.413 --> 26:25.613
to the front fucking lines.

26:25.893 --> 26:27.073
Bro, I saw that clip.

26:27.233 --> 26:29.253
All you motherfuckers talking all this shit.

26:29.333 --> 26:30.793
You don't know what you're talking about, dude.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.133
You have no idea.

26:32.213 --> 26:33.413
You haven't been paying attention.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.253
You're sucked into your own life.

26:35.253 --> 26:39.093
You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.335
And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.

26:42.795 --> 26:43.375
You know what?

26:44.155 --> 26:47.995
You weren't embarrassed when our country was run by a literal vegetable.

26:47.995 --> 26:49.995
You weren't embarrassed when...

26:51.475 --> 26:55.275
They stole all your money and closed your businesses and fucked with you.

26:55.595 --> 27:00.515
You weren't embarrassed when our whole country is a laughingstock of the entire world

27:00.515 --> 27:05.095
because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons running our country.

27:05.335 --> 27:06.555
Trans titties on the front line.

27:06.555 --> 27:09.715
Bro, we got trans generals and, you know, we got kids.

27:09.835 --> 27:11.875
We're promoting kids cutting off their dick.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.595
And everybody else in the world is like.

27:14.493 --> 27:19.473
the fuck is going on in the u.s you weren't embarrassed about that shit but you're embarrassed

27:19.473 --> 27:26.273
about this man and this other man who have finally said uh no you're not gonna fucking do this shit

27:26.273 --> 27:33.693
here okay i actually thought in my opinion that was the coolest baddest ass gangster ass shit

27:33.693 --> 27:38.733
that i've ever seen from either one of those guys for sure bro so uh if you don't like it

27:38.733 --> 27:41.733
and that's embarrassing to you then maybe you should fucking move

27:42.168 --> 27:45.188
Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.

27:45.548 --> 27:48.748
And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls, okay?

27:48.808 --> 27:49.928
I call it how I see it.

27:49.948 --> 27:51.208
If he does good, he does good.

27:51.248 --> 27:52.448
If he does bad, he does bad.

27:52.808 --> 27:53.488
That's great.

27:53.948 --> 27:54.508
That's not good.

27:54.568 --> 27:55.008
That's great.

27:55.168 --> 27:55.548
That's great.

27:55.708 --> 27:55.948
Okay?

27:56.308 --> 27:58.128
This motherfucker's stealing your money.

27:58.428 --> 28:01.388
You guys are out here working, and that's the problem.

28:01.488 --> 28:03.848
A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.288
They're not working.

28:04.288 --> 28:04.528
Right?

28:04.668 --> 28:08.248
So they don't see that tax be taken out of their check.

28:08.248 --> 28:11.248
and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.

28:12.020 --> 28:16.640
Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugattis.

28:17.740 --> 28:18.380
He's got two bugs?

28:18.560 --> 28:18.820
Yeah.

28:19.120 --> 28:19.420
Damn.

28:20.220 --> 28:20.840
Are they cool, though?

28:21.560 --> 28:23.220
I mean, have you seen a bad Bugatti?

28:23.300 --> 28:23.820
Yeah, that's true.

28:23.940 --> 28:24.360
That's fair.

28:24.625 --> 28:26.425
I'm just saying, dude, like, that's not.

28:26.525 --> 28:27.185
That's not okay.

28:27.385 --> 28:28.685
No, it's cool for me to have to.

28:29.785 --> 28:30.525
You know what I'm saying?

28:30.725 --> 28:34.525
But I didn't, you know, I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.

28:34.625 --> 28:34.945
Exactly.

28:35.205 --> 28:36.905
You know, like, dude, fuck this guy.

28:37.025 --> 28:37.205
Yeah.

28:37.425 --> 28:40.705
No, I mean, well, so this is what started that whole chain of events, right?

28:40.745 --> 28:41.065
So you got.

28:41.065 --> 28:42.005
I hate this motherfucker.

28:42.105 --> 28:42.785
Oh, bro, I can't stand him.

28:42.785 --> 28:44.785
And I can't stand people standing up for him.

28:44.785 --> 28:47.145
It's so, it's stupid shit.

28:47.710 --> 28:54.770
But after he left the Oval Office, he decided to go back to Europe,

28:54.770 --> 28:56.910
and he did a little tour.

28:56.910 --> 28:57.990
Did you hear what he said today?

28:58.710 --> 29:00.670
About our kids?

29:00.690 --> 29:01.070
Our troops.

29:01.270 --> 29:01.910
You got that clip?

29:02.090 --> 29:02.770
I can put it in.

29:03.150 --> 29:05.430
Bro, this guy gets on television today.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.710
You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.

29:08.669 --> 29:10.169
This guy gets on TV today.

29:10.729 --> 29:11.489
Today is Monday.

29:11.809 --> 29:13.249
Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.

29:13.669 --> 29:22.309
And he fucking says, the United States is going to have to send its sons and daughters to fight in Ukraine, and they will die.

29:22.509 --> 29:25.169
That's what he said, his almost verbatim exact quote.

29:26.429 --> 29:34.069
Dude, if we send a single soldier over there, like a single fucking soldier, this administration is no different than any other one.

29:34.149 --> 29:34.249
100%.

29:34.769 --> 29:35.149
Yeah.

29:35.309 --> 29:36.229
Yeah, 100%, man.

29:36.867 --> 29:40.667
But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour

29:40.667 --> 29:42.667
So he stopped to stop in the UK

29:43.087 --> 29:47.687
He went to the UK first. He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food. They got over there

29:49.107 --> 29:51.307
Gordon Ramsay's only one knows how to make food over there

29:53.727 --> 29:55.727
That's why he's so fucking famous, bro

29:56.387 --> 30:00.247
That's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's the only one over there who knows how to make food
