1
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:06,138
Sleepin' on the floor, now my jewelry box froze.

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:09,438
Fuck a bowl, fuck a stove, counted millions in a cold.

3
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:12,758
Bad bitch, booted swole, got her own bankroll.

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:16,118
Can't fold, just a note, headshot, case closed.

5
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:20,058
What is up guys, it's Andy Frisella and this is the show for the real.

6
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:23,298
Let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness, and delusions of modern society.

7
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:24,678
Welcome to motherfuckin' reality.

8
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:28,878
Guys, today we have Andy and DJ!

9
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:31,228
Cruz the motherfucking internet.

10
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,088
That's what we're going to do.

11
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,448
That's what CTI stands for.

12
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:34,868
It stands for Cruz the internet.

13
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:37,828
I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.

14
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:40,688
But what we do here is we put topics on the screen.

15
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:43,008
We speculate on what's true and what's not true.

16
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:48,648
And then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems that all these knuckleheads create.

17
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,168
Let's just get right into it.

18
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:53,308
We don't run ads on the show.

19
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,029
So we ask that you don't be a hoe.

20
00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,209
And you share the show.

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:00:59,689
There you go.

22
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,309
Yep.

23
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:01,969
You're looking good, man.

24
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:02,429
Is it?

25
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,909
Damn.

26
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,429
Yeah.

27
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,709
I saw you trying to start work out, and I know what the fuck you're up to.

28
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:07,529
What am I up to?

29
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:09,789
Trying to fucking catch up and beat me.

30
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,149
I can't let you.

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,520
I can't let you.

32
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,120
I can't.

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,360
Bro, you look good, man.

34
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:16,620
Shit.

35
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,520
You're looking good.

36
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,140
I don't know if it might just be the sweater.

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,560
I don't think it's the sweater, though.

38
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,280
No, it's my face.

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,840
Fuck, man.

40
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,620
Like, hey.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,200
Yeah.

42
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:23,820
What's up?

43
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,780
You tell me.

44
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,700
You look good, too, bro.

45
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,340
Thanks, man.

46
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,860
Pull me down.

47
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,300
Yeah.

48
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,240
We had a big event this weekend.

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,380
Dude, that was a big historic event.

50
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:32,900
Right.

51
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:32,960
Yeah.

52
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Yeah.

53
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,558
Big Jim turns 80 years old yesterday.

54
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:39,578
Shit.

55
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:40,738
We went to dinner on Saturday.

56
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:41,498
It was a good time.

57
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,078
It was good.

58
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:42,998
It was a good time, man.

59
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:43,718
It's always nice.

60
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:44,538
It's always nice.

61
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,538
He was kind of surprised.

62
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:48,958
You know, he's been around, man.

63
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,918
It's hard to get him.

64
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:52,903
I mean, he's been around that many blocks.

65
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:53,303
Yeah.

66
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,123
I mean, he fought in the Civil War.

67
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,443
He's seen it, thank you, too.

68
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:01,083
That's for sure.

69
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:01,503
Yeah.

70
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:02,823
80 years.

71
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:03,463
Fuck, man.

72
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:04,443
That's a long time.

73
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:05,463
Yeah, still moving, though.

74
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:06,963
We ought to get him on the show, maybe.

75
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:08,703
I mean, if you got-

76
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:09,563
Do an interview of his 80 years.

77
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:13,303
Yeah, if you guys are ready for a six-hour podcast, let us know.

78
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:14,523
That's the truth.

79
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:16,803
It's going to be an all-day affair.

80
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:19,026
What else going on?

81
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,046
It'll be fucking good, though, man.

82
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:20,266
Yeah.

83
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,606
Yeah, everything is good, man.

84
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,106
You know, everything is good.

85
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:24,586
We got a lot to talk about.

86
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:25,506
I bet.

87
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:26,006
Yeah.

88
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:26,966
I bet.

89
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:28,486
Let's do some cruising.

90
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:29,146
Let's do it.

91
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:33,786
Before we get to our headlines, you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce

92
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,366
in there for you.

93
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:36,866
We just landed on the moon.

94
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:38,926
Who did?

95
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:39,746
We did.

96
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,006
Me and you?

97
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:41,986
No, like America.

98
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:42,526
Oh.

99
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:43,066
Yep.

100
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:43,806
Lunar Lander.

101
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:50,072
Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon. This is first time

102
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:53,332
ever

103
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:59,552
How about say, you know, I was gonna say, you know, I would believe this when chicks can grow

104
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:02,512
You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage

105
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:08,132
You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah and be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real like

106
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:10,632
You just can't.

107
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,152
If you do, I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.

108
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:17,612
Bro.

109
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:24,772
Like, you just can't tell me that's real.

110
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:25,172
I'm sorry.

111
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,892
Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.

112
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:28,772
You know what I'm saying?

113
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:30,632
Well, apparently they can.

114
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,192
Well, one's more truer than the other, though.

115
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,852
Did you see that study I sent you?

116
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,621
Oh, yeah, dude, that's sad.

117
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:45,601
Bro, I sent DJ a study today, and they said that they ran some studies on people who actually transition.

118
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:56,081
So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they transition, they have a likelihood suicide rate of, I think, like 48%.

119
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,341
Right, and so doing the surgery saves their lives.

120
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,821
Yes, that's the justification for these people.

121
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,241
But now there's been a study that's come out.

122
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:07,638
A recent study published in Oxford's.

123
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:08,698
Yeah, well, you know Oxford.

124
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:09,798
They don't know what they're doing.

125
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:10,858
They trust science there.

126
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:25,258
Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.

127
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:27,278
So it goes from 48 to 96.

128
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:29,718
I ain't going mad.

129
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:33,118
Who's counting, man?

130
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:33,418
Yeah.

131
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,565
I would have never guessed.

132
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:40,805
I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis,

133
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,385
that eventually you're going to regret it.

134
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:43,125
You're going to have some problems.

135
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:46,385
I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts,

136
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,025
eventually you're going to regret it.

137
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:52,985
I would have never guessed if you sewed your vagina shut

138
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:57,545
and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis,

139
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:58,785
that I would regret that.

140
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,585
I mean, who would have known?

141
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:02,205
Who would have known?

142
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:03,982
I mean, I'm shocked.

143
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:06,442
Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.

144
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:08,262
First of all, it's a lot of cutting.

145
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:10,242
All right, but second of all.

146
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,302
Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.

147
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:12,642
Bullshit.

148
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:13,302
No, bullshit.

149
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:13,762
Yeah, bro.

150
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:14,122
Bullshit.

151
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:14,622
Yeah.

152
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:15,282
What do you mean?

153
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,142
What did I miss?

154
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,602
Wait, what did she say?

155
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:18,822
What'd she say?

156
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:19,322
I don't know.

157
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:20,062
She said something.

158
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:20,902
I can't say it.

159
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,122
I'll call her ass right now.

160
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:22,442
Yeah.

161
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:33,464
um no i mean but it makes sense bro you can't just do that man like and here's the thing

162
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:39,064
it's common sense bro it is but here's the thing this is a relatively new thing in our society and

163
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:44,104
the problem is is that they were able to spout all of these justifications there wasn't enough

164
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:48,184
time for these type of studies to even come through you got to follow that out you

165
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:51,224
know what i'm saying it takes some time to get a good base of evidence there

166
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,570
And, yeah, so, I mean, it makes sense.

167
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,810
But, yeah, so, I mean, Chicks with Dicks is more possible than going to the moon, though.

168
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,130
Yeah.

169
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:57,650
Yeah.

170
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,650
The funniest thing about this, though, real quick, so, you know, Buzz Aldrin?

171
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:03,450
Yeah.

172
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,290
I didn't know he was still alive.

173
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,890
He's still alive.

174
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,150
Is he?

175
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,470
And they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time.

176
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,070
It reports lunar gravity, and it is stable.

177
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,530
Come on.

178
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,310
That's fake, too.

179
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:21,254
Alcon, she mentioned here.

180
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:22,314
Looks better than any of you.

181
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:23,534
Y'all suck land.

182
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:24,114
We're out of here.

183
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:26,094
Okay.

184
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:35,134
He's like, shit, so that's what it really looks like.

185
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:38,134
Here's a picture they supplied.

186
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,174
This is supposed to be.

187
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:39,894
Who took the picture?

188
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:43,494
I don't know.

189
00:06:44,354 --> 00:06:44,574
Yeah.

190
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:50,806
Anyway, we all know the government's liars, and we all know NASA's liars,

191
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:55,346
and we all know it's a massive money laundering scheme, just like all the other shit.

192
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:58,986
How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA

193
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:03,926
and then filtered back through different SPFs and perks and donations and funding?

194
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:08,801
Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do, like, any real, like, you know, crazy shit.

195
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:11,801
Like, you know, like, if they fuck with, like, any aliens or something.

196
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:12,321
You know what I'm saying?

197
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:13,401
Like, that maybe is the front.

198
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,681
Like, it's a front for something.

199
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:16,441
I'm a firm believer that.

200
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:17,901
I just said what it was a front for.

201
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,661
It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.

202
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:26,841
Yeah, but, like, I think originally, like, the whole reason we even did that was to, like, fucking, you know, funnel the money to cover up the fucking Cold War and shit.

203
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:27,241
You know?

204
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:27,501
I don't know.

205
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:29,357
Beat the Russians, you know.

206
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:32,297
Well, that was the original motivation.

207
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,237
But nobody went.

208
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:35,097
That's right.

209
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:36,197
Nobody fucking went, bro.

210
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:40,397
They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.

211
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,377
I mean, that's what that was about.

212
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:43,397
That was the basis of it, yeah.

213
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:44,637
Race to the moon.

214
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:45,137
Yep.

215
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,317
We'll beat you.

216
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,077
Out here in Arizona, you might as well stop.

217
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:52,687
Yeah, man.

218
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:53,807
It is what it is, man.

219
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,227
But guys, hope you're ready for a show.

220
00:07:56,827 --> 00:08:01,747
Remember, if you wanted to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to andyfussella.com.

221
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:02,947
You want to make people real mad?

222
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:03,407
What?

223
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,387
You tell them that the earth isn't flat.

224
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:06,427
Oh, fuck.

225
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,287
Now, hold on.

226
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:07,807
Now, you listen.

227
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:10,287
The flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.

228
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:10,767
No, listen.

229
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,567
I mean, there's an argument.

230
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:13,547
No, there's not.

231
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,667
There's an argument, bro.

232
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,047
We've been up in planes.

233
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:16,767
What does it look like?

234
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:22,874
You've seen what I've seen.

235
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:25,814
I'm just saying, bro.

236
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:26,714
40,000 feet up.

237
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,994
You motherfuckers think the Earth's flat?

238
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:29,674
Joe does.

239
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:31,114
Joe Young does.

240
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,274
I know Joe Young does.

241
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:32,634
Yeah, bro.

242
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:33,454
We're ice shelfers.

243
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,094
I think ice shelf could be true.

244
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:36,374
No.

245
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:38,994
If that's true, then the Earth's flat.

246
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:39,774
I think...

247
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:40,894
No.

248
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:41,894
Yeah.

249
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:42,514
No.

250
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:45,194
Ice shelf theory is not about flat Earth.

251
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:46,718
It's about-

252
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:47,558
No, I'm not saying it is.

253
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:50,018
I'm saying if that is true, though, then it would have to be true.

254
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:52,098
No, there's still going to be some curvature.

255
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:53,338
It's like a fishbowl.

256
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:57,118
No, it's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head.

257
00:08:58,298 --> 00:08:58,878
Like you.

258
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:00,858
If you just drew a little circle on your hat.

259
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,918
You wore one of them little hats, you know, those little tiny ones on your head.

260
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,398
The pointy ones or the-

261
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:07,298
No, the little ones.

262
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,738
You know, those little round hats.

263
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:14,537
A condom, Andy?

264
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,257
What are you talking about?

265
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:18,097
Like, what kind of hat on my head?

266
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:19,797
You know.

267
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:20,217
All right.

268
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:21,977
Anyway.

269
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:22,697
Yeah, man.

270
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:23,397
Hey, listen.

271
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:24,757
Go to Andy.com.

272
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,137
Yeah.

273
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,517
Go to AndyFacella.com.

274
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,780
I wonder where it takes you to andy.com.

275
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,140
Is that a real thing?

276
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,580
Let's get into our headlines, man.

277
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,060
We got some interesting stuff.

278
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,140
Let's start with first series of headlines.

279
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,000
Headline number one.

280
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,660
I wanted to get into this,

281
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,560
and this may be some foreshadowing going on.

282
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,360
I don't know, but I saw it,

283
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,220
and I immediately felt that this is not good.

284
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:52,195
So J.D. Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.

285
00:09:53,255 --> 00:10:00,335
And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.

286
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:00,675
Right.

287
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:02,275
Like that's a typical security thing.

288
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:02,595
Right.

289
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,795
I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.

290
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:08,015
We post it after on the fucking plane ride home.

291
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:08,595
You know what I'm saying?

292
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:09,815
Like that's a typical thing.

293
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:10,075
Right.

294
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:16,095
And so J.D. Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.

295
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:21,142
And before he even got there, I don't know if you guys saw this.

296
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:27,802
There was some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.

297
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,262
All right.

298
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:31,442
Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?

299
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:35,482
Well, if you got I mean, first of all, people don't understand.

300
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:45,427
The level of logistics that has to go into organizing even a couple of hundred people together at the same time to get them into a specific location ahead of time.

301
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:49,747
This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail that needs to be removed.

302
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:51,878
There's no way.

303
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:55,598
That's not, like, how would they know that information ahead of time?

304
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,058
To even organize 500 fucking people to get there.

305
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,838
Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.

306
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:02,858
Leaking that shit out, bro.

307
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,478
And like I said, it wasn't a couple, bro.

308
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:06,638
It was a shit ton of them.

309
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:06,998
Yeah.

310
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,218
Vance is a traitor.

311
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,198
Go ski in Russia.

312
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,158
Vance equals Putin's pawn equals traitor.

313
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:14,678
So, dude, these people.

314
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:22,990
think that Putin is the problem. All the while, people are being arrested for making social media

315
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:28,850
posts all through Europe. Okay. We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women and

316
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,770
stabbing people and killing them who aren't European.

317
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:33,094
Okay?

318
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:37,154
We have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.

319
00:11:37,894 --> 00:11:38,154
Okay?

320
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:43,194
And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already happening?

321
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:44,054
Going on around them.

322
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:44,574
Yeah, right.

323
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:46,834
Like, what are you guys fighting for?

324
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:48,374
You know?

325
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:54,434
These people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the media,

326
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:59,114
and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.

327
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:09,045
All right. And dude, did you see that? That comment I got from I told I did I show you that comment I got from one of the people who follows me about the Ukraine shit.

328
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:20,685
Yeah. He's like Ukraine's a sovereign nation. And, you know, we as the most powerful country in the world have a responsibility to stick up for countries that can't defend themselves.

329
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:23,045
Well, let me stop you right there, homie. No, we don't.

330
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:27,163
We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.

331
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:32,783
And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.

332
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:37,823
It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.

333
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:43,923
OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.

334
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,670
An actual war because of our involvement with NATO.

335
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,630
They're sending troops in.

336
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:02,490
They would rather blow up the entire world than to have the truth about the entire fucking system that oppresses citizens globally to come out and how they do it.

337
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:02,950
Yeah, right.

338
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,690
Right.

339
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,850
But they're supposed to be the people of peace and love and tolerance.

340
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,430
And here we are.

341
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,130
It's insane, dude.

342
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,290
World War III on the doorstep.

343
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:10,550
Yeah.

344
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,570
For what reason?

345
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,450
For what reason?

346
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,010
What reason?

347
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:19,262
The only reason that these people all want this war, I'm not talking about these morons.

348
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:23,342
I'm talking about the people who are actually making the decisions.

349
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:24,182
Who write the shit on paper.

350
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:27,642
Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.

351
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:35,742
The only reason they want to do that is because they don't want the truth to come out about how all these nations collaborate to oppress the citizens of humanity.

352
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:36,142
Yep.

353
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,002
Yep, 100%, man.

354
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:41,042
Like I said, I saw this, and I'm just foreshadowing, bro.

355
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:42,222
This is some dangerous shit.

356
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:46,142
And they definitely need to lock that shit in.

357
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:46,702
You know what I'm saying?

358
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:51,882
Because we've seen what happens when you have leaks in your security team twice now with Donald Trump.

359
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:52,962
I mean, fuck.

360
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:58,482
J.D. Vance obviously being an incumbent potential running candidate for 2028.

361
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:01,262
I mean, bro, like, I mean, it'd be a good way to get him out beforehand.

362
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,882
They got somebody fucking in this team.

363
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:03,602
I'm telling you right now.

364
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:04,462
A hundred percent, dude.

365
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:05,382
There's no doubt.

366
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,470
They need to watch it.

367
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,610
Listen, this administration is still full with rats.

368
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,170
It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.

369
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,950
You know, it's still full of this.

370
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,190
Yeah.

371
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:23,719
Yeah. Well, so what kicked off all of this Putin nonsense?

372
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:31,119
We got to go back a couple of days to this meeting that happened with Trump, Vance, and Zelensky of Ukraine.

373
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:38,499
Now, I will say this, because we got plenty of criticism to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.

374
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,839
Look what these people call him, dude.

375
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,279
Protester held sign labeling Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.

376
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:43,619
Yeah.

377
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,159
You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.

378
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,379
You don't know it.

379
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:54,899
And you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with polarizing viewpoints.

380
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:56,279
It's the same thing they did with racism.

381
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,059
Yeah, dude.

382
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:57,559
Exactly.

383
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,319
And now people are like, well, you know what?

384
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:01,903
Black people do steal shit.

385
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:02,223
Yeah.

386
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,403
I mean, it's like, no.

387
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:05,463
Bro, that, no.

388
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:06,443
You know what?

389
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:06,923
No.

390
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:13,363
It's almost good that they do this because they devalue their defense mechanism.

391
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,243
Well, their offense mechanism, right?

392
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:15,523
Right.

393
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,063
Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.

394
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:17,403
Right.

395
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:18,903
Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.

396
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:20,603
And that shit ain't working anymore.

397
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:21,283
No one cares.

398
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:21,483
No.

399
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,283
And it just exposed how radical they are.

400
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:24,723
Yes.

401
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:27,023
And what the truth that they actually are trying to push behind.

402
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:27,563
Well, unfortunately.

403
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:33,425
also it brings a it brings to the surface the element that they claim to want to suppress

404
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:40,605
um you know when you call everybody racist for 20 fucking years eventually they're like yeah you

405
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:45,445
know what i am because i'm tired of getting called this and this and this from you fuckers fuck you

406
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:51,945
simply right yeah like dude and what happens is you you end up radical they end up radicalizing

407
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:52,425
people.

408
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,530
It works the opposite of what they want.

409
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,570
They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.

410
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,170
Normal people.

411
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,270
You know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.

412
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,890
That's not good for society.

413
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:12,550
Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that, you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.

414
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,870
Like.

415
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:17,056
I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.

416
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:20,876
And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that.

417
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:25,996
Because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks about their own race.

418
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:30,336
And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,

419
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:33,676
I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.

420
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:36,436
So I never made my race my identity.

421
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:39,476
I never said, yeah, I'm fucking proud to be white.

422
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:40,876
That was never a thing.

423
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:48,153
I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says, dude, the content of their character, who they are, you know.

424
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:50,193
And I think most people are like that.

425
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:52,473
And I think we're getting to a point where.

426
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,483
You know, everybody's coming back to that,

427
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:57,643
and these people who are calling all the names

428
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,803
are going to be ostracized.

429
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:00,143
Like, nobody's listening to this shit.

430
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,663
We're fucking Nazi.

431
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:03,983
Bro, you don't even know what,

432
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:06,323
you don't even know anything about the history

433
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,643
of fucking Nazi movement.

434
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:10,563
You don't know anything of the history of World War I

435
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,483
or World War II or how the Federal Reserve was formed.

436
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:16,243
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

437
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:16,923
Period.

438
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:18,947
That's just it.

439
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:19,447
No, it's stupid.

440
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:20,147
They don't know.

441
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,327
And they use these fucking terms, dude.

442
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,367
And I'm going to tell you what, man.

443
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,107
I get called every name in the book now.

444
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:29,667
I don't care.

445
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:30,607
Yeah, I take it.

446
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:31,867
I mean, I like smile.

447
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,627
I wear them as badges of honor.

448
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:36,587
Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye's got a fucking swastika t-shirt?

449
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,407
Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.

450
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:44,293
And you guys can get mad about that all you want, but he's forcing you to pay attention.

451
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:51,593
And then when you look at the symbol and the history of a swastika, you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.

452
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:56,753
And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune and prosperity through human history.

453
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:59,313
And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.

454
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,513
Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?

455
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,541
Do you think he used that to represent evil?

456
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:07,781
In his mind, that's what he was fighting for.

457
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:13,181
Yeah, he was, in his mind, he was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.

458
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:18,141
And then since then, that symbol has been, you know, you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.

459
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:21,061
Well, bro, if you go to Eastern cultures, it's everywhere.

460
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:21,981
It's on the buildings.

461
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:25,341
It's, I mean, it's still, is that not true, Syed?

462
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:25,801
Yeah, sorry.

463
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:26,221
Yeah.

464
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:27,781
So, like.

465
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:34,190
You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.

466
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:34,530
No.

467
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,670
And it's like, and dude, let's pay attention.

468
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,890
Who are, let's, who are these people?

469
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,650
Who are they?

470
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,110
What race are they?

471
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,470
Oh, they're all white.

472
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,250
Oh, they're all white.

473
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,090
And what gender are they?

474
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,190
All women.

475
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,670
And what age are they?

476
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:52,958
I mean, they're bruncher age for sure.

477
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:54,278
And what are they wearing?

478
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:59,158
Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking $400 jackets.

479
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:00,058
Right, right.

480
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,378
Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably just got laid off from USAID.

481
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,418
Yeah, for sure.

482
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:09,258
Listen, this group of people.

483
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:15,717
is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because

484
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:20,917
they are so privileged they don't have any worries they live in upper middle class

485
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:26,757
areas and they drink champagne on sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and

486
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:31,237
because they don't have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to

487
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:36,037
seem virtuous and care stand up for the right thing the thing you go go actually go to

488
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,857
to Ukraine. Go fight in fucking Ukraine.

489
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:38,977
I don't want to hear it, dude.

490
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,408
I don't give a fuck.

491
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:41,068
You know what?

492
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:42,168
I'm America first.

493
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:42,988
Period.

494
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,008
I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel, or anybody else.

495
00:19:47,448 --> 00:19:49,168
Here first, then there.

496
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:55,288
And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.

497
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,488
Doesn't matter who it is.

498
00:19:57,028 --> 00:20:02,028
And, by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.

499
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:05,472
Makes sense to me, man.

500
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,272
But guys, let's slow this down.

501
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:11,152
Let's talk about how we even got to having these protests.

502
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,172
You know why the United States funds all these countries?

503
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:14,832
Do you know why?

504
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:15,532
Because we have to.

505
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:15,932
No.

506
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:17,012
That's not why.

507
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:21,026
The United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.

508
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:25,706
They golden handcuffed these countries, okay?

509
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,006
So they either say, hey, we'll give you this aid,

510
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:30,106
but you can't make this and this and this and this and this

511
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:31,786
as part of the agreement, right?

512
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,646
Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.

513
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:38,046
Or they give them the money knowing that...

514
00:20:37,998 --> 00:20:42,218
The United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation.

515
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:43,138
Any prosperity.

516
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:46,258
Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.

517
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:47,718
It's no different than a rich kid.

518
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:48,398
Okay?

519
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:52,538
You got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep giving him money, keep giving him money,

520
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:54,598
keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money.

521
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:58,238
Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?

522
00:20:58,438 --> 00:20:58,558
No.

523
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,058
Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.

524
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:01,798
Okay?

525
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:05,598
If you keep foreign aiding a country, what I'm saying here is that...

526
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,020
We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally.

527
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,380
Yeah.

528
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,560
And it needs to fucking stop.

529
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,120
Yeah, bro.

530
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,160
Take them off the teat, bro.

531
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,540
Make them learn how to get the food themselves.

532
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,260
Get strong or get conquered.

533
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,740
I don't give a fuck.

534
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,700
I don't care.

535
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,020
I'm American, bro.

536
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,420
I care about us first.

537
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,180
Do I care about people in Europe?

538
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,380
Yeah, I got friends in Europe.

539
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,860
Do I care about people in Australia?

540
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,600
Yeah, I do.

541
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,540
Do I care about them more than us?

542
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,640
No, sorry, I don't.

543
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,340
I care about us.

544
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,359
Yeah, 100%, bro.

545
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:35,979
But yeah, let's slow this down.

546
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:42,259
Let's see where this all started, because we've got to go back a couple of days to a meeting that Trump, Vance, and Zelensky had at the White House.

547
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,299
And this was the first time we got to really see any type of negotiations, I guess, with the press corps being there.

548
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:51,135
which I believe was part of Trump's play.

549
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:58,695
I mean, obviously, because apparently word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind cameras.

550
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:03,435
And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see his true colors.

551
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:04,615
So let's check this clip out.

552
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,940
I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.

553
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,460
Yes, but if you are not strong...

554
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,020
Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office

555
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
and try to litigate this in front of the American media.

556
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,620
Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines

557
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,360
because you have manpower problems.

558
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,120
You should be thanking the President to bring an end to this conflict.

559
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,860
Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?

560
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,363
I have been to...

561
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:31,063
Count once.

562
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,643
I've actually watched and seen the stories,

563
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,963
and I know what happens is you bring people,

564
00:22:37,283 --> 00:22:39,623
you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.

565
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:44,123
Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?

566
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:44,683
We have problems.

567
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:49,163
And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America

568
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:53,443
and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?

569
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:54,763
A lot of questions.

570
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,103
Let's start from the beginning.

571
00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:56,343
Sure.

572
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:58,103
First of all, during the war,

573
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:05,974
Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future

574
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:09,454
God bless you don't know that God bless you. God bless you

575
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:14,214
Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother was a threat. Hold on stop it

576
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:19,674
That was a fucking hundred percent. That was a fucking threat a hundred percent

577
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:22,008
Fuck this little motherfucker.

578
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:26,488
Throw him in the fucking wood chipper right there, and the war ends.

579
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,788
Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.

580
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:34,548
This motherfucker wants the war because him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.

581
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:35,148
You get paid.

582
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,239
Get paid, bro.

583
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,199
That was a fucking...

584
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,639
Bro, you're sitting in the Oval Office.

585
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:41,499
What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is...

586
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:41,899
Immediately?

587
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,359
No.

588
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,579
I love how Trump's sitting.

589
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:44,439
He's letting him talk.

590
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:44,699
Yeah.

591
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:45,439
Let's him talk.

592
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,019
Let's him talk.

593
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:46,539
Let's him talk.

594
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:47,119
Let's him talk.

595
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,679
The guy gets one inch out of line, and he said, hold on.

596
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,359
And then let's play the rest.

597
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,419
It fucking hammers him, bro.

598
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,779
Tell us what we're going to feel.

599
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,739
I'm not telling you.

600
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,739
Because you're in no position to dictate that.

601
00:23:58,879 --> 00:23:59,499
Remember this.

602
00:23:59,639 --> 00:23:59,979
I'm not telling you.

603
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:03,919
You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

604
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:21,983
We're going to feel very good. We're going to feel very good and very strong. You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about it. You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now.

605
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,700
With us, you start having cards.

606
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,300
I'm not playing cards.

607
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,040
Right now, you're playing cards.

608
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm very serious, Mr. President.

609
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,180
You're playing cards.

610
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,820
I'm very serious.

611
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,460
You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

612
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,880
You're gambling with World War III.

613
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,780
You're gambling with World War III.

614
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,120
And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.

615
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,700
It's back to you.

616
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm with all respect to you.

617
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,800
Far more than a lot of people said they should have.

618
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,000
Have you said thank you once?

619
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,415
A lot of times.

620
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,695
Even today.

621
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:54,735
You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.

622
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:58,555
Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America

623
00:24:58,555 --> 00:25:02,295
and the president who's trying to save your country.

624
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,475
And your life.

625
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:06,862
Look, dude, he's dead anyway.

626
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:07,922
They're going to kill this dude.

627
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:10,402
Listen, either side's going to do it.

628
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:10,962
Yeah, for sure.

629
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:11,622
He's getting killed.

630
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:12,702
This guy's fucking done.

631
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:15,682
They can't let that dude walk knowing what he knows, bro.

632
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:16,762
No, not only that.

633
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:17,542
No, he stole.

634
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:18,942
Dude, he knows where all the money went.

635
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:20,482
He knows exactly where it went.

636
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:21,222
You know what I'm saying?

637
00:25:21,282 --> 00:25:22,282
They can't let that dude walk.

638
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:50,629
Yeah. See, you know, we call it how we see it. A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset. I saw this like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American. I'm so dis listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters. Okay. Real talk. You've never had to fight for anything. You've never had to negotiate for anything. This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men. Okay.

639
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,087
When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.

640
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:55,747
And that's what Trump does.

641
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:59,147
He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.

642
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:01,067
He just threatened our country, bro.

643
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:01,387
Dude.

644
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,827
And we got people in this country.

645
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,607
What are we going to feel?

646
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:04,007
Brother.

647
00:26:04,007 --> 00:26:04,507
If we don't help?

648
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:04,727
Wait.

649
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:05,087
Brother.

650
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:10,527
First of all, we got people in this country that fucking are on his side.

651
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:14,533
Like, bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.

652
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,733
Go over there.

653
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:16,693
Go live in Europe.

654
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:17,733
Go live in Ukraine.

655
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:18,373
They'll take you.

656
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:23,413
And then they'll take you to the front lines like they're taking people with Down syndrome

657
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,613
to the front fucking lines.

658
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:27,073
Bro, I saw that clip.

659
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:29,253
All you motherfuckers talking all this shit.

660
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,793
You don't know what you're talking about, dude.

661
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,133
You have no idea.

662
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:33,413
You haven't been paying attention.

663
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,253
You're sucked into your own life.

664
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:39,093
You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.

665
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,335
And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.

666
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:43,375
You know what?

667
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:47,995
You weren't embarrassed when our country was run by a literal vegetable.

668
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:49,995
You weren't embarrassed when...

669
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:55,275
They stole all your money and closed your businesses and fucked with you.

670
00:26:55,595 --> 00:27:00,515
You weren't embarrassed when our whole country is a laughingstock of the entire world

671
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:05,095
because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons running our country.

672
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:06,555
Trans titties on the front line.

673
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:09,715
Bro, we got trans generals and, you know, we got kids.

674
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,875
We're promoting kids cutting off their dick.

675
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,595
And everybody else in the world is like.

676
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:19,473
the fuck is going on in the u.s you weren't embarrassed about that shit but you're embarrassed

677
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:26,273
about this man and this other man who have finally said uh no you're not gonna fucking do this shit

678
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:33,693
here okay i actually thought in my opinion that was the coolest baddest ass gangster ass shit

679
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:38,733
that i've ever seen from either one of those guys for sure bro so uh if you don't like it

680
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,733
and that's embarrassing to you then maybe you should fucking move

681
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,188
Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.

682
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:48,748
And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls, okay?

683
00:27:48,808 --> 00:27:49,928
I call it how I see it.

684
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,208
If he does good, he does good.

685
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:52,448
If he does bad, he does bad.

686
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:53,488
That's great.

687
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:54,508
That's not good.

688
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:55,008
That's great.

689
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:55,548
That's great.

690
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:55,948
Okay?

691
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,128
This motherfucker's stealing your money.

692
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,388
You guys are out here working, and that's the problem.

693
00:28:01,488 --> 00:28:03,848
A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.

694
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,288
They're not working.

695
00:28:04,288 --> 00:28:04,528
Right?

696
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:08,248
So they don't see that tax be taken out of their check.

697
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:11,248
and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.

698
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,640
Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugattis.

699
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,380
He's got two bugs?

700
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,820
Yeah.

701
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,420
Damn.

702
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,840
Are they cool, though?

703
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,220
I mean, have you seen a bad Bugatti?

704
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,820
Yeah, that's true.

705
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,360
That's fair.

706
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,425
I'm just saying, dude, like, that's not.

707
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:27,185
That's not okay.

708
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:28,685
No, it's cool for me to have to.

709
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,525
You know what I'm saying?

710
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:34,525
But I didn't, you know, I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.

711
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:34,945
Exactly.

712
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,905
You know, like, dude, fuck this guy.

713
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:37,205
Yeah.

714
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:40,705
No, I mean, well, so this is what started that whole chain of events, right?

715
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:41,065
So you got.

716
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:42,005
I hate this motherfucker.

717
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:42,785
Oh, bro, I can't stand him.

718
00:28:42,785 --> 00:28:44,785
And I can't stand people standing up for him.

719
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:47,145
It's so, it's stupid shit.

720
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:54,770
But after he left the Oval Office, he decided to go back to Europe,

721
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,910
and he did a little tour.

722
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,990
Did you hear what he said today?

723
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,670
About our kids?

724
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,070
Our troops.

725
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,910
You got that clip?

726
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,770
I can put it in.

727
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,430
Bro, this guy gets on television today.

728
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,710
You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.

729
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:10,169
This guy gets on TV today.

730
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:11,489
Today is Monday.

731
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,249
Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.

732
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:22,309
And he fucking says, the United States is going to have to send its sons and daughters to fight in Ukraine, and they will die.

733
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:25,169
That's what he said, his almost verbatim exact quote.

734
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:34,069
Dude, if we send a single soldier over there, like a single fucking soldier, this administration is no different than any other one.

735
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,249
100%.

736
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:35,149
Yeah.

737
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,229
Yeah, 100%, man.

738
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:40,667
But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour

739
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,667
So he stopped to stop in the UK

740
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:47,687
He went to the UK first. He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food. They got over there

741
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:51,307
Gordon Ramsay's only one knows how to make food over there

742
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:55,727
That's why he's so fucking famous, bro

743
00:29:56,387 --> 00:30:00,247
That's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's the only one over there who knows how to make food
