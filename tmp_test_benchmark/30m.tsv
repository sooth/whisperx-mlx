33528	35229	It stands for Cruz the internet.
36368	38549	I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.
38528	40789	But what we do here is we put topics on the screen,
40768	43709	we speculate on what's true and what's not true.
43688	46309	And then we talk about how we the people
46288	47469	have to solve these problems
47448	49069	that all these knuckleheads create.
50088	52109	Let's just get right into it.
52088	53669	We don't run ads on the show.
55229	57250	So we ask that you don't be a hoe.

78020	79261	I don't know if it might just be the sweater.
79240	80661	I don't think it's the sweater though.
80640	81501	Oh, it's my face.
81480	82341	Fuck man.
82320	83181	Like, hey.

100078	101698	We went to dinner on Saturday for a good time.
101678	102539	It was good.
102518	103379	It was a good time, man.
103358	104219	It's always nice.
104198	105059	It's always nice.
105038	106818	He was kind of surprised.
107798	108979	You know, he's been around, man.
108958	111098	It's hard to get him.
111423	113043	We've been around that many blocks.
113023	115043	Yeah.
115023	119043	I mean, he fought in the Civil War.
119023	119545	He's seen it.
119523	120045	He's seen it.
120023	121244	Thank you to that's for sure.
121223	121745	Yeah.
121723	122245	Yeah.
122223	122844	80 years.
122823	123644	Fuck man.
123623	124444	That's a long time.
124423	124746	Yeah.
124723	125644	Still moving though.
125623	127643	We ought to get them on the show maybe.
127623	129643	I mean, if you have an interview of his 80 years.
129623	129848	Yeah.
129823	132043	If you guys are ready for a six hour podcast.
132023	132644	Oh my God.
132623	133844	Let us know.
133823	135643	That's the truth.
135623	138043	It's going to be an all day affair.
138406	139267	What else going on?
139246	140107	It'll be fucking good though, man.
140086	142186	No, yeah, everything is good, man.
142166	143187	You know, everything is good.
143166	145026	We got a lot to talk about.
145006	145867	I bet.
145846	148666	Yeah, let's do some cruising.
148646	151186	Before we get to our headlines,
151166	153826	you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce
153806	154667	in there for you.
155886	157307	We just landed on the moon.
158606	159467	Who did?
159446	160387	We did.
160366	161227	We mean you?
161206	162307	No, like America.
162286	164106	Oh, yeah, Lunalander.
164832	169352	Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon.
169332	171993	This is first time ever.
175472	178752	How about I say, you know, I was going to say, you know, I would believe this
178732	179653	when chicks can grow.
179632	182652	You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage.
182932	185753	You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah.
185832	187953	And be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real.
187932	188255	Like.
189892	191312	You just can't.
191292	192153	If you do,
194172	197272	I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.
197252	198113	Bro.
203212	205272	You just can't tell me that's real, I'm sorry.
205252	208192	Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.
208172	209033	You know what I'm saying?
209012	210712	Well, apparently they can.
210692	212272	Well, one's more true than the other though.
212252	213113	Yeah.
213092	213953	Yeah.
213932	216112	Did you see that study I said you?
216301	217682	about, oh yeah, dude, that's sad.
217661	222121	Bro, the, the, I said DJ has studied today and they said that, uh,
222101	225761	they ran some studies on people who actually transition.
225741	230561	So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they
230701	234521	transition, they have a suicide, a likelihood suicide rate of, I think,
234501	235462	like 48%.
235503	236321	Right.
236301	238321	And so doing the surgery saves their lives.
238301	240801	Yes, that's the justification for these people.
240781	241127	Right.
241249	243201	Now there's been a study that's come out.
243638	247259	Does this say a recent study published in Oxford's?
247678	248819	Yeah, we know Oxford.
248798	249899	They don't know what they're doing.
249878	250959	They trust science there.
250938	251301	Yeah.
252045	257959	Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people
258238	263159	found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender
263138	265299	dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.
265278	267399	So it goes from 48 to 96.
268778	269759	I ain't going mad.
269738	270919	Yeah.
272038	272099	So.
272078	273219	He's counting, man.
273198	274739	Yeah.
273625	282405	I would have never guessed I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis that eventually you're gonna regret it
282385	283272	It has a problem.
283352	288025	I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts eventually you're going to regret it
288005	290426	I would have never guessed if you
291305	298685	So'd your vagina shut and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis that I would regret that
298665	302086	I mean who would have known who would have known
303342	304203	I mean, I'm shocked.
304182	307282	Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.
307262	308963	First of all, it's a lot of cutting.
308942	310643	All right, but second of all.
310622	312363	Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.
312342	314323	Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
314302	315163	Yeah.
315142	316523	What did I miss?
316502	318363	Wait, what did she say?
318342	319203	What did she say?
319182	320203	I don't know, she said something.
320182	321043	I can't say it.
321022	322243	I'll call her ass right now.
322222	323083	Yeah.
322664	329884	Um, no, I mean, but it makes sense.
330064	331885	Well, you can't just do that shit, man.
331864	333525	Like, and here's the thing.
333504	335245	It's common sense, bro.
335224	335743	It is.
335764	336325	But here's the thing.
336304	339044	This is a relatively new thing in our society.
339024	341164	And the problem is, is that they were able to
341144	343125	spout all of these justifications.
343264	346644	There wasn't enough time for these type of studies to even come through.
346824	348165	You got to follow that shit out.
348144	348584	You know what I'm saying?
348584	351324	It takes some time to get a good base of evidence there.
351790	356811	And yeah, so I mean it makes sense, but yeah, so I mean chicks with dicks is more possible than going to the moon though
356790	358491	Yeah, yeah
358470	362780	The funniest thing about this though real quick is so you know buzz buzz Aldrin.
363304	364210	I didn't know he was still alive
364190	365137	He's alive.
365740	370330	Is he and they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time
376510	378531	Come on, that's fake too
380174	382195	Conch you've been snare
392894	395034	He's like shit, so that's what it really looks like
396614	399754	Here's a picture they supplied this is supposed to be who took the picture
402774	404795	Oh, yeah
406246	413486	Anyway, we all know the government's liars and we all know NASA's liars and we all know it's a massive laundering money laundering scheme
413466	415418	Just like all the other shit.
415961	420246	How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA and then filter back through
421366	424026	Different spiffs and perks and donations and funding
424201	428481	Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do like any real like, you know, crazy
428461	432061	shit like, you know, like if they fuck with like any aliens or something and you know
432041	433382	what I'm saying, like that maybe is the front.
433361	437381	Like it's a front for something like I'm a firm believer that I just said what it was
437361	438382	a front for.
438361	439941	It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.
439921	442901	Yeah, but like I think originally like the whole reason we even did that was to like
442881	447341	fucking, you know, funnel the money and recover up the fucking Cold War and shit, you know.
447877	449457	the beat the Russians, you know.
449717	452337	Well, that was the that was the original motivation.
452317	453090	Yeah.
453110	454697	But we didn't nobody went.
454677	455128	That's right.
455251	456297	Nobody fucking went, bro.
456277	460457	They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.
460437	461208	That or that.
461310	463097	I mean, that's that's what that was a basis of.
463077	463465	Yeah.
463670	464857	Race to the moon.
464837	465950	Yeah.
465970	468297	We beat you.
468277	469310	I hear it Arizona.
469330	471497	You might as well stop.
471477	471477	
472227	473848	Yeah man, it is what it is man.
473827	477007	But guys, hope you're ready for a show.

481747	483208	You wanna make people real mad?
483187	484048	What?
484027	485768	You tell them that the earth isn't flat.
485747	488088	Oh fuck, now hold it, now you listen.
488067	490288	Them flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.
490267	492968	No listen, I mean, there's an argument.
492947	493808	No there's not.
493787	495248	There's no argument bro.
495227	497488	We've been up in planes, what does it look like?
501674	502935	You've seen what I've seen.
504954	506855	I'm just saying, bro, 40,000 you
506834	508095	will stick the earth flat.
509034	510295	Joe does Joe.
510314	511175	Joe Young does.
511154	512375	I know Joe Young does.
512354	512657	Yeah, bro.
512634	513535	We're ice shelfers.
514234	516175	You think I think I shelf could be true.
516194	519094	No, I just for it's true than the earth's flat.
519114	519696	I think I.
520434	521255	That's no.
521474	522056	Yeah.
522034	525294	No, ice shelf theory is not about flat earth.
526278	530158	It's about I'm not saying it is I'm saying if that is true though, then it would have to be no
530138	532281	There's still going to be some curvature.
532625	533818	It's like a fishbowl because you know
533798	536998	It's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head
538098	541778	Like you if you just drew a little circle on your hat you wore one of them little hats
541758	547198	You know those little tiny ones on your head which the the pointy ones or the no the little ones
547478	549658	You know those little round hats
553717	556417	A condom, any way he talking about like a fucking way,
556397	558337	kind of hat on the head.
559877	560738	All right.
561637	562498	Anyway.
562477	565177	Yeah man, hey listen, go to 80.com.
565157	566697	Go to 804Seller.com.
567200	568780	I wonder what it takes you to Andy.com.
569200	570181	Is that a real thing?
571280	572620	Let's get into our headlines, man.
572600	574100	We've got some some interesting stuff.
574080	577220	Let's start with first first series of headlines.
577200	581620	Had on number one, I wanted to get into this and this may be some foreshadowing
581960	582584	going on.
582705	587300	I don't know, but I saw it and I immediately felt that this is not good.
587635	592216	So JD Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.
593395	597496	And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation
597475	600361	shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.
600583	600745	Right.
600765	601976	Like that's a typical security
601955	602278	thing.
602399	602621	Right.
603286	605847	I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.
605867	606936	We post it after
606915	608050	on the fucking plane ride home.
608111	608739	You know what I'm saying?
608760	609834	Like that's a typical thing.
609854	609976	Right.
610755	616055	And so JD Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.
616762	627822	And before he even got there, I don't know if you guys saw this, there was some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.
628842	629365	All right.
629385	631437	Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?
631880	635582	Well, if you got, I mean, first of all, people don't understand.
636387	638568	The level of logistics it has to go into,
638547	641527	organizing even a couple of hundred people together
641507	644767	at the same time to get them into a specific location
644747	646088	ahead of time.
646067	648948	This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail
648927	650448	that needs to be removed.
650798	652339	There's no way, there's no way.
652318	654539	That's not, like, how would they know
654518	655979	that information ahead of time?
655958	658099	To even organize 500 fucking people in there.
658078	661899	Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.
661878	663339	Leaking that shit out, bro.
663318	665539	And like I said, it wasn't, like, it wasn't a couple, bro.
665518	666859	It was a shit ton of them.
666838	667699	Yeah.
667678	670219	Vance is a trader, go ski in Russia.
670198	673659	Vance equals Putin's pawn equals trader.
673638	675059	So dude, these people,
675790	682710	think that Putin is the problem all the while people are being arrested for making social
682690	685251	media posts all through Europe.
685230	690610	We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women and stabbing people and killing them
690590	692011	who aren't European.
692834	697374	Okay, we have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.
697914	698257	Okay.
698234	702814	And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already
702794	704135	happening going on around them.
704234	704617	Yeah, right.
704594	707014	Like, what do we, what are you guys fighting for?
708034	714174	You know, these people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the
714154	719174	media and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.
719885	723825	All right, and dude, did you see that comment I got from,
723805	725865	I told, did I show you that comment I got
725845	728305	from one of the people who follows me about-
728285	729146	The Ukraine shit?
729125	729986	Yeah.
729965	730826	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
730805	732505	He's like, Ukraine's a sovereign nation
732485	736865	and we as the most powerful country in the world
736845	739745	have a responsibility to stick up for countries
739725	740825	that can't defend themselves.
740805	742665	Well, let me stop you right there, homie.
742645	743506	No, we don't.
743763	747323	We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.
747563	752883	And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.
753103	757823	It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.
758443	764263	OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.
765650	769270	an actual war because of our involvement with NATO.
769250	770990	They're sending troops in.
770970	773390	They would rather blow up the entire world
773370	778030	than to have the truth about the entire fucking system
778010	781470	that oppresses citizens globally to come out
781450	782550	and how they do it.
782530	783830	Yeah, right, right.
783810	785910	But they're supposed to be the people of peace
785890	788510	and love and tolerance and here we are.
788490	789351	It's insane, dude.
789330	790351	One more three on the doorstep.
790330	791830	Yeah, for what reason?
791810	792671	For what reason?
792650	793511	Exactly.
793490	794351	What reason?
794962	797942	The only reason that these people all want this war,
797922	799742	I'm not talking about these morons.
799722	802782	I'm talking about the people who are actually
802762	803623	making the decisions.
803602	804463	Write the shit on paper to face it.
804442	808542	Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.
808522	809942	The only reason they want to do that
809922	811782	is because they don't want the truth to come out
811762	813942	about how all these nations collaborate
813922	816022	to oppress the citizens of humanity.
816002	816863	Yep.
816882	818063	Yep, 100% man.
818042	821102	Like I saw this and I just foreshadowing, bro,
821082	822503	this is some dangerous shit.
823802	826263	And they definitely need to lock that shit in,
826242	827103	you know what I'm saying?
827082	828103	Because we've seen what happens
828082	830663	when you have leaks in your security team
830642	832303	twice now with Donald Trump.
832282	834623	I mean, fuck, JD Vance obviously being,
834602	837662	you know, an incumbent potential running candidate
837642	838583	for 2028.
838562	839983	I mean, bro, like, I mean,
839962	841543	be a good way to get him out beforehand.
841522	842943	They got somebody fucking in this scene.
842922	843783	I'm telling you, I know.
843762	844623	100% they need to fucking lock it.
844602	845623	There's no doubt.
845570	846653	Maybe to watch it there.
846874	850626	Listen, this administration is still full with rats.
851208	855240	It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.
855842	858009	You know, it's still full of this.
858129	858230	Yeah.
858479	858761	Yeah.
859366	863939	Well, so what kicked off all of this, this, uh, you know, Putin nonsense.
863919	867939	We got to go back a couple of days to this, this, uh, this meeting that happened
867919	871219	with Trump, Vance and Zelensky of Ukraine.
871639	875639	Um, now I will say this, like, I mean, I, cause we got plenty of criticism
875619	878619	to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.
878639	879860	Look what these people call them, dude.
879839	883339	Protester held signed labeling, Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.
883439	883703	Yeah.
883759	886299	You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.
886559	892579	You don't know it and and and you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with
893599	896419	Polarizing viewpoints the same thing they did with racism.
896439	899219	Yeah, dude exactly now people are like well, you know what?
900683	901944	Black people do still shit.
901923	907024	Yeah, like, I mean, bro, that, no, you know what?
907003	909384	It's almost good that they do this
909363	913504	because they devalue their defense mechanism.
913483	915504	Well, their offense mechanism, right?
915483	917424	Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.
917403	919304	Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.
919283	920624	And that shit ain't working anymore.
920603	921664	No one cares.
921643	924424	And it just exposed how radical they are.
924403	925264	Yes.
925243	926104	And what the truth that they actually
926083	927144	are trying to push behind them.
927123	927984	Well, unfortunately,
927565	931826	Eventually also it brings to the surface the element
931805	933826	that they claim to want to suppress.
934805	937186	You know, when you call everybody racist
937165	939346	for 20 fucking years,
939325	941406	eventually they're like, yeah, you know what?
941385	943666	I am because I'm tired of getting called this
943645	945626	and this and this from you fuckers, fuck you.
945605	946666	Simply fuck you, right?
946645	949066	Yeah, like dude, and what happens is
949045	952846	you end up, they end up radicalizing people.
953570	955630	It works the opposite of what they want.
955610	959670	They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.
959650	962330	Normal people, you know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.
962310	964390	That's not good for society.
964370	968690	Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that,
968910	972590	you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.
972570	972893	Like.
973516	977096	I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.
977316	980856	And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that
981076	984616	because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks
984796	986337	about their own race.
986316	990456	And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,
990436	993696	I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.
993996	996536	So I never made my race my identity.
996516	999536	I never I never said, you know, I'm fucking proud to be white.
999516	1001536	That was never a thing.
1001613	1004833	I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says,
1004813	1010433	do the content of their character, who they are, you know, and I think most people are like that.
1010413	1012353	And I think we're getting to a point where
1013223	1018843	You know, everybody's coming back to that and these people who are calling all the names are going to be ostracized.
1018823	1020243	Like nobody's listening to shit.
1020523	1021943	Oh, fucking Nazi.
1022323	1027843	Bro, you don't even know what you don't even know anything about the history of fucking Nazi movement.
1028023	1033643	You don't know anything of the history of World War One or World War Two or how the Federal Reserve was formed.
1033823	1036243	You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
1036423	1037144	Period.
1038367	1039228	That's just it.
1039207	1040048	No, it's stupid.
1040027	1040888	They don't know.
1040867	1043447	And they use these fucking terms, dude.
1043427	1044947	I'm gonna tell you what, man.
1047547	1049227	I get called every name in the book now.
1049207	1050068	I don't care.
1050047	1050908	Yeah, I take it that way.
1050887	1052127	I mean, I like smile.
1052107	1053727	I wear them as badges of honor.
1053707	1055087	Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye
1055067	1056807	has got a fucking swastika t-shirt?
1056787	1057648	Yeah.
1057627	1059207	Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.
1059173	1061754	You know, and you guys can get mad about that all you want.
1061733	1064834	But he's forcing you to pay attention.
1064813	1066394	And then when you look at the symbol
1066373	1068294	in the history of a swastika,
1068273	1071894	you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.
1071873	1075134	And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune
1075113	1077074	and prosperity through human history.
1077053	1079534	And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.
1079513	1081874	Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?
1081921	1085981	Do you think he used that to represent evil in his mind?
1085961	1087821	That's what he was he was before.
1087801	1090081	Yeah, he was in his mind.
1090061	1093221	He was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.
1093201	1095981	And then since then, that symbol has been, you know,
1095961	1098241	you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.
1098661	1101141	Well, bro, if you go to eastern cultures, it's everywhere.
1101121	1102054	It's on the buildings.
1102135	1104041	It's it's I mean, it's still.
1104021	1104783	Is that not true?
1105112	1105442	Say it.
1105421	1106064	It's right.
1106085	1106542	Yeah.
1106521	1107742	So like.
1108870	1114188	You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.
1114450	1114490	No
1115270	1117792	It's like and dude, let's pay attention.
1117832	1119931	Who are let's who are these people?
1120790	1121636	Who are they?
1122099	1123105	What race are they?
1123951	1124534	Oh, they're all white.
1124696	1127010	They're all white and what gender are they?
1126990	1129611	No, all women and what age are they?
1130318	1133039	Uh, I mean, they're brunch or age for sure.
1133018	1134739	And and what are they wearing?
1134718	1137239	Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking
1137218	1139439	Canada goose, $400 jackets.
1139418	1140439	Right, right.
1140418	1141439	Hmm.
1141418	1142939	Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably.
1142918	1144139	These motherfuckers listen to you.
1144118	1145539	They got laid off from USAID.
1145518	1146939	Yeah, no, for sure.
1146918	1149439	Listen, that group, this group of people.
1149877	1155737	is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because
1155717	1161417	they are so privileged they don't have any worries they fucking live in upper middle class areas and
1161397	1167257	they drink champagne on Sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and because they don't
1167237	1172457	have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to seem virtuous and care
1172437	1177417	stand up for the fucking right thing the thing you go actually go to Ukraine go fight and fucking
1177397	1178258	Can you create anything?
1178237	1179457	I don't want to hear it, dude.
1179408	1180453	I don't give a fuck.
1180654	1181117	You know what?
1181237	1182182	I'm America first.
1182725	1183228	Period.
1183489	1187188	I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel or anybody else.
1187168	1189198	Here first, then there.
1189238	1195428	And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.
1195408	1196414	Doesn't matter who it is.
1197199	1202128	And by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.
1202108	1204128	No.
1204332	1205640	Makes sense to me, man.
1205801	1207351	But guys, let's slow this down.
1207411	1210752	Let's let's let's talk about how we even got to, you know, having you know,
1210732	1213233	why the you know, why the United States funds all these countries?
1214252	1214840	Do you know why?
1214881	1217153	Because we have to know that's not why.
1218406	1221146	United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.
1221826	1225186	They go and have a golden handcuffed these these countries.
1225426	1225928	Okay.
1226066	1229126	So they either say, Hey, we'll give you this aid, but you can't make this and
1229106	1231846	this and this and this and this as part of the agreement, right?
1231826	1233726	Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.
1234226	1237486	Or they give them the money knowing that.
1237998	1242658	the United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation and
1242638	1243386	prosperity.
1243750	1246338	Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.
1246318	1247770	It's no different than a rich kid.
1248274	1251258	OK, you got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep
1251238	1254138	giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep
1254118	1254663	giving him money.
1254724	1258338	Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?
1258878	1261158	Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.
1261662	1263458	OK, if you keep foreign aiding,
1263438	1263804	to cut.
1264129	1265858	What I'm saying here is that
1266500	1270600	We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally and it needs to fucking stop.
1270580	1271208	Yeah, bro.
1271228	1272282	Take them off the tee, bro.
1272302	1273720	Make them learn how to get the food themselves.
1274820	1276390	Get strong or get conquered.
1276772	1277759	I don't give a fuck.
1278121	1278705	I don't care.
1278765	1280114	I'm American, bro.
1280376	1281000	I care about us
1280980	1281444	first.
1281928	1283361	Do I care about people in Europe?
1283381	1284491	Yeah, I got friends in Europe.
1284591	1285560	Do I care about people in
1285540	1286043	Australia?
1286104	1286607	Yeah, I do.
1287030	1289527	Do I care about them more than us?
1289829	1290695	No, sorry, I don't.
1290755	1291400	I care about us.
1292099	1293560	Yeah, so 100% bro.
1294659	1296040	But yeah, let's slow this down.
1296019	1297600	Let's see where this all started.
1297579	1299600	Cause we gotta go back a couple of days to a meeting
1299579	1302999	that Trump Vance and Zelinski had at the White House.
1302979	1305319	And this was the first time we got to really see
1305299	1307120	any type of negotiations, I guess,
1307099	1308720	with the press corps being there.
1308535	1311356	Which I believe was part of Trump's play.
1311335	1312356	I mean, obviously.
1312335	1317955	Because, apparently, word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind
1317935	1318956	cameras.
1318935	1323516	And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see us through color.
1323495	1324636	So let's check this clip out.
1325360	1328980	I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.
1328960	1329981	Yes, but if you are not strong...
1329960	1334260	Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try
1334240	1336580	to litigate this in front of the American media.
1336560	1341080	Right now you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you
1341060	1342820	have manpower problems.
1342800	1345940	You should be thanking the President to bring it into this conflict.
1345920	1348780	Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?
1349103	1359803	I have been to come once I have actually I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people you bring them on a propaganda tour Mr. President.
1359983	1366043	Are do you disagree that you've had problems with bringing people in your military and do you think that it's respectful.
1366023	1373243	I will answer to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to try to prevent the destruction of your.
1373223	1374916	A lot of questions.
1375078	1376529	Let's start from the beginning.
1376549	1378243	First of all, during the war...
1378634	1386334	Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future
1387674	1389695	God bless you
1390554	1392475	Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother.
1392496	1393143	That was a threat.
1393365	1393790	Hold on.
1393932	1394174	Stop it
1395434	1399694	That was a fucking 100 that was a fucking threat 100 percent
1400588	1405649	fuck this little motherfucker, throw him in the fucking wood chipper, right there, and
1405628	1406474	the war ends.
1407099	1408851	Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.
1409516	1411329	This motherfucker wants the war because
1411308	1415329	him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.
1415759	1417500	Okay, but that was a fucking diary, bro.
1417479	1418740	You're sitting in the oval office.
1418719	1421499	What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is.
1421479	1422125	Immediately?
1422250	1422500	No.
1422479	1423580	I love how Trump's sitting.
1423559	1424500	He's letting them talk.
1424479	1424822	Yeah.
1424799	1427699	Let's him talk, let's him talk, let's him talk, let's him talk.
1427679	1430019	The guy gets one inch out of line and he says,
1429999	1432259	Oh, hold on.
1432239	1433260	And then let's play the rest.
1433239	1434460	Fucking hammers him, bro.
1434439	1435820	Tell us what we're going to feel.
1435799	1436740	I'm not telling you.
1436719	1438819	Because you're in no position to dictate that.
1438799	1439860	Remember this.
1439839	1443979	You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.
1444463	1446484	You will feel influenced.
1446463	1450484	I'm telling you, you will feel influenced.
1450463	1452484	You're right now not in a very good position.
1452463	1455484	You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position.
1455463	1457484	And it happens to be right about you.
1457463	1460484	From the very beginning of the war, Mr. Rahab, I was...
1460463	1461402	You're not in a good position.
1461423	1462484	You don't have the cards right now.
1462300	1464321	With us you start having cars.
1464300	1466321	But right now you don't have your plane cars.
1466300	1470321	You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.
1470300	1473321	You're gambling with World War III.
1473300	1476321	You're gambling with World War III.
1476300	1481321	And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.
1481300	1482792	It's back to you.
1483095	1486321	Far more than a lot of people said they should have.
1487275	1488496	a lot of times.
1488475	1489896	No, even today.
1489875	1491196	Even today.
1491175	1495136	You went to Pennsylvania and campaign for the opposition in October,
1495115	1498936	offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America,
1498915	1502436	and the president who's trying to save your country.
1503675	1504696	And your life.
1505602	1507062	Look, dude, he's dead anyway.
1507042	1508262	Let him kill this dude.
1508242	1510422	Listen, either side's going to do it.
1510402	1510983	Yeah, for sure.
1510962	1511703	He's getting killed.
1511682	1512822	This guy's fucking done.
1512802	1515822	They can't let that dude walk, like knowing what he knows, bro.
1515802	1516782	No, not only that.
1516762	1517663	No, he stole.
1517642	1518942	Dude, he knows where all the money went.
1518922	1520662	He knows exactly where it went.
1520642	1521303	You know what I'm saying?
1521282	1523502	They can't let that dude walk.
1522409	1524909	Yeah, see, you know, we call it how we see it.
1525169	1530409	A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset.
1530389	1533749	I saw this, like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American.
1533729	1538189	I'm so dis, listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters.
1538309	1538711	Okay.
1538689	1539390	Real talk.
1539709	1541530	You've never had to fight for anything.
1541689	1543710	You've never had to negotiate for anything.
1543889	1550029	This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men.
1550309	1550811	Okay.
1551367	1554147	When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.
1554527	1556107	And that's what Trump does.
1556087	1559347	He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.
1559327	1561147	He just threatened our country, bro.
1561127	1561437	Oh, dude.
1561726	1562387	And we got people.
1562367	1563747	And what are we going to feel?
1563727	1564567	Brother, we don't help.
1564608	1565427	Wait, brother.
1565407	1568227	First of all, we got people in this country
1568207	1570587	that fucking are on his side.
1571313	1574613	Like bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.
1575093	1575874	Go over there.
1576033	1576854	Go live in Europe.
1576953	1577854	Go live in Ukraine.
1577833	1578414	They'll take you.
1578933	1580573	And then they'll take you to the front lines.
1580773	1585753	Like they're taking people with down syndrome to the front fucking lines.
1585933	1587154	Bro, I saw that clip.
1587213	1590913	All you motherfuckers talking all this shit, you don't know what you're talking about, dude.
1591173	1592214	You have no idea.
1592193	1593653	You haven't been paying attention.
1593853	1595353	You're sucked into your own life.
1595533	1599293	You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.
1599815	1602835	And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.
1602815	1604235	You know what?
1604215	1606835	You weren't embarrassed when our country was run
1606815	1608675	by a literal vegetable.
1608655	1610335	You weren't embarrassed when...
1611475	1613976	They stole all your money and closed your businesses
1613955	1615736	and fucked with you.
1615715	1617696	You weren't embarrassed when our whole country
1617675	1621116	is a laughing stock of the entire world
1621095	1624256	because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons
1624235	1625336	running our country.
1625315	1626496	Trans titties on the front line.
1626475	1629936	Bro, we got trans generals and we got kids,
1629915	1631896	we're promoting kids cutting off their dick
1631875	1634096	and everybody else in the world is like.
1634493	1636713	the fuck is going on in the US?
1636693	1638753	You weren't embarrassed about that shit,
1638733	1640793	but you're embarrassed about this man
1640773	1643313	and this other man who have finally said,
1643293	1646993	no, you're not gonna fucking do this shit here.
1646973	1650233	Okay, I actually thought, in my opinion,
1650213	1654033	that was the coolest, baddest ass, gangster ass shit
1654013	1655713	that I've ever seen from either one of those guys.
1655693	1656554	For sure, bro.
1656533	1660033	So if you don't like it and that's embarrassing to you,
1660013	1662013	then maybe you should fucking move.
1662168	1665308	Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.
1665488	1668548	And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls.
1668528	1669948	OK, I call it how I see it.
1669928	1671268	If he does good, he does good.
1671248	1672748	If he does bad, he does bad.
1672728	1673542	That's great.
1674030	1674579	That's not good.
1674600	1675108	That's great.
1675128	1675605	That's great.
1675812	1676269	OK.
1676248	1678348	This motherfucker stealing your money.
1678328	1681468	You guys are out here working and that's the problem.
1681448	1683908	A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.
1683888	1684438	They're not working.
1684460	1684629	Right.
1684608	1688308	So they don't get, they don't see that tax be taken out of their check
1688528	1691348	and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.
1692020	1696680	Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugatti's.
1697660	1698457	He's got two bucks.
1698621	1698887	Yeah.
1699214	1699480	Damn.
1700140	1701560	Are they cool though?
1701540	1703320	I mean, you see a bad Bugatti.
1703300	1703860	Yeah, that's true.
1704006	1704400	That's fair.
1704625	1707326	I'm just saying, dude, like that's not, that's not okay.
1707305	1708926	No, it's cool for me to have to.
1708905	1710726	You know what I'm saying?
1710705	1712726	But I didn't, you know,
1712705	1714606	I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.
1714585	1715446	Exactly, exactly.
1715425	1717006	You know, like dude, fuck this guy.
1716985	1717846	Yeah.
1717825	1719326	No, I mean, well, so this is what started
1719305	1720726	that whole chain of events, right?
1720705	1722126	So you got, I hate this motherfucker.
1722105	1722966	Oh, bro, I can't stand it.
1722945	1724846	And I can't stand people standing up for him.
1724825	1727366	It's so, it's stupid shit.
1727710	1737090	But after he left the oval office, he decided to go back to Europe and he did a little tour.
1737070	1741091	Did you hear what he said today about the, about our troops?
1741070	1741891	You got that clip?
1741870	1743091	I can put it in.
1743070	1745331	Bro, this guy gets on television today.
1745310	1747731	You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.
1748669	1750729	This guy gets on TV today.
1750709	1752090	Today is Monday.
1752069	1754090	Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.
1754069	1755930	And he fucking says,
1755909	1759129	the United States is gonna have to send his sons and daughters
1760109	1762569	to fight in Ukraine and they will die.
1762549	1765449	That's what he said is almost verbatim exact quote.
1766709	1769769	Dude, if we send a single soldier over there,
1769749	1772129	like a single fucking soldier,
1772109	1774209	this administration is no different than any other one.
1774189	1775050	100%.
1775029	1775544	Yeah.
1775626	1776450	Yeah, 100%, man.
1776867	1780687	But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour
1780667	1782688	So he stopped to stop in the UK
1783107	1784742	He went to the UK first.
1785105	1787687	He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food they got over there
1789107	1791328	Gordon Ramsay's the only one else I make food over there
1793707	1799527	That's why he's so fucking famous bro, that's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's only one over there
