1
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:04,599
sleeping on the floor.

2
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:06,279
Now my jewelry box froze.

3
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:07,919
Fuck a boat, fuck a stove.

4
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:09,599
Counted millions in a cold.

5
00:00:09,578 --> 00:00:11,279
Bad bitch, boot it slow.

6
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:12,919
Got her on bank row.

7
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:13,759
Can't fold.

8
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:14,599
Duss a note.

9
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:16,959
Head shot, case closed.

10
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:17,919
What is up, guys?

11
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:18,839
It's Andy for Selling.

12
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,119
This is the show for the real.

13
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:21,719
Let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness,

14
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:23,399
and delusions of modern society.

15
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:25,479
And welcome to motherfucking reality, guys.

16
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,399
Today, we have Andy and DJ.

17
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:31,389
Cruz the motherfucking in there.

18
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,229
That's what we're gonna do.

19
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,549
That's what CTI stands for.

20
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,229
It stands for Cruz the internet.

21
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:38,549
I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.

22
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:40,789
But what we do here is we put topics on the screen,

23
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:43,709
we speculate on what's true and what's not true.

24
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:46,309
And then we talk about how we the people

25
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:47,469
have to solve these problems

26
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,069
that all these knuckleheads create.

27
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:52,109
Let's just get right into it.

28
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:53,669
We don't run ads on the show.

29
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,250
So we ask that you don't be a hoe.

30
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,330
And you share the shell.

31
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,170
There you go.

32
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,010
Yep.

33
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,130
You're looking good, man.

34
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,210
Damn.

35
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,649
Yeah, I saw you trying to start work out

36
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:06,970
and I know what the fuck you're up to.

37
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:07,810
What am I up to?

38
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:10,569
Trying to fucking catch up and beat me.

39
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:11,410
I can't let you.

40
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,741
I can't let you.

41
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,241
I got, I can't.

42
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,381
Bro, you look good, man.

43
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,221
Shit.

44
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,041
You're looking good.

45
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,261
I don't know if it might just be the sweater.

46
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,661
I don't think it's the sweater though.

47
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,501
Oh, it's my face.

48
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,341
Fuck man.

49
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,181
Like, hey.

50
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,181
Yeah, what's up?

51
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,021
You tell me.

52
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,861
You look good too, bro.

53
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,701
Thanks man.

54
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,541
Pull me down.

55
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,541
Yeah.

56
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,861
We went to, we had a big event this weekend.

57
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,501
Dude, that was a big historic event.

58
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,341
Right.

59
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:39,258
Big Jim turns 80 years old yesterday.

60
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:40,099
Shit.

61
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:41,698
We went to dinner on Saturday for a good time.

62
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,539
It was good.

63
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:43,379
It was a good time, man.

64
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:44,219
It's always nice.

65
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:45,059
It's always nice.

66
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,818
He was kind of surprised.

67
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:48,979
You know, he's been around, man.

68
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,098
It's hard to get him.

69
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,043
We've been around that many blocks.

70
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:55,043
Yeah.

71
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:59,043
I mean, he fought in the Civil War.

72
00:01:59,023 --> 00:01:59,545
He's seen it.

73
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:00,045
He's seen it.

74
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:01,244
Thank you to that's for sure.

75
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:01,745
Yeah.

76
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:02,245
Yeah.

77
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:02,844
80 years.

78
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:03,644
Fuck man.

79
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,444
That's a long time.

80
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:04,746
Yeah.

81
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:05,644
Still moving though.

82
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:07,643
We ought to get them on the show maybe.

83
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:09,643
I mean, if you have an interview of his 80 years.

84
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:09,848
Yeah.

85
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:12,043
If you guys are ready for a six hour podcast.

86
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:12,644
Oh my God.

87
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:13,844
Let us know.

88
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:15,643
That's the truth.

89
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:18,043
It's going to be an all day affair.

90
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:19,267
What else going on?

91
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:20,107
It'll be fucking good though, man.

92
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,186
No, yeah, everything is good, man.

93
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,187
You know, everything is good.

94
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,026
We got a lot to talk about.

95
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:25,867
I bet.

96
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,666
Yeah, let's do some cruising.

97
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:31,186
Before we get to our headlines,

98
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,826
you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce

99
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:34,667
in there for you.

100
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:37,307
We just landed on the moon.

101
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:39,467
Who did?

102
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:40,387
We did.

103
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,227
We mean you?

104
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:42,307
No, like America.

105
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:44,106
Oh, yeah, Lunalander.

106
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:49,352
Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon.

107
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:51,993
This is first time ever.

108
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:58,752
How about I say, you know, I was going to say, you know, I would believe this

109
00:02:58,732 --> 00:02:59,653
when chicks can grow.

110
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:02,652
You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage.

111
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,753
You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah.

112
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:07,953
And be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real.

113
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:08,255
Like.

114
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:11,312
You just can't.

115
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,153
If you do,

116
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:17,272
I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.

117
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:18,113
Bro.

118
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:25,272
You just can't tell me that's real, I'm sorry.

119
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:28,192
Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.

120
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,033
You know what I'm saying?

121
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:30,712
Well, apparently they can.

122
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,272
Well, one's more true than the other though.

123
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:33,113
Yeah.

124
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:33,953
Yeah.

125
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:36,112
Did you see that study I said you?

126
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,682
about, oh yeah, dude, that's sad.

127
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:42,121
Bro, the, the, I said DJ has studied today and they said that, uh,

128
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:45,761
they ran some studies on people who actually transition.

129
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:50,561
So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they

130
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:54,521
transition, they have a suicide, a likelihood suicide rate of, I think,

131
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,462
like 48%.

132
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:56,321
Right.

133
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:58,321
And so doing the surgery saves their lives.

134
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,801
Yes, that's the justification for these people.

135
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:01,127
Right.

136
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:03,201
Now there's been a study that's come out.

137
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:07,259
Does this say a recent study published in Oxford's?

138
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:08,819
Yeah, we know Oxford.

139
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:09,899
They don't know what they're doing.

140
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:10,959
They trust science there.

141
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:11,301
Yeah.

142
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:17,959
Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people

143
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,159
found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender

144
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,299
dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.

145
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:27,399
So it goes from 48 to 96.

146
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:29,759
I ain't going mad.

147
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:30,919
Yeah.

148
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:32,099
So.

149
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,219
He's counting, man.

150
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:34,739
Yeah.

151
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:42,405
I would have never guessed I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis that eventually you're gonna regret it

152
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:43,272
It has a problem.

153
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:48,025
I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts eventually you're going to regret it

154
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:50,426
I would have never guessed if you

155
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:58,685
So'd your vagina shut and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis that I would regret that

156
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,086
I mean who would have known who would have known

157
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,203
I mean, I'm shocked.

158
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:07,282
Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.

159
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:08,963
First of all, it's a lot of cutting.

160
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,643
All right, but second of all.

161
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:12,363
Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.

162
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:14,323
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

163
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:15,163
Yeah.

164
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:16,523
What did I miss?

165
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:18,363
Wait, what did she say?

166
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:19,203
What did she say?

167
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:20,203
I don't know, she said something.

168
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:21,043
I can't say it.

169
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:22,243
I'll call her ass right now.

170
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,083
Yeah.

171
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:29,884
Um, no, I mean, but it makes sense.

172
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,885
Well, you can't just do that shit, man.

173
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,525
Like, and here's the thing.

174
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,245
It's common sense, bro.

175
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:35,743
It is.

176
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:36,325
But here's the thing.

177
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:39,044
This is a relatively new thing in our society.

178
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:41,164
And the problem is, is that they were able to

179
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:43,125
spout all of these justifications.

180
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:46,644
There wasn't enough time for these type of studies to even come through.

181
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,165
You got to follow that shit out.

182
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:51,324
It takes some time to get a good base of evidence there.

183
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,811
And yeah, so I mean it makes sense, but yeah, so I mean chicks with dicks is more possible than going to the moon though

184
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,491
Yeah, yeah

185
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,780
The funniest thing about this though real quick is so you know buzz buzz Aldrin.

186
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:04,210
I didn't know he was still alive

187
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,137
He's alive.

188
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,330
Is he and they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time

189
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,531
Come on, that's fake too

190
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:22,195
Conch you've been snare

191
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:35,034
He's like shit, so that's what it really looks like

192
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:39,754
Here's a picture they supplied this is supposed to be who took the picture

193
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:44,795
Oh, yeah

194
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:53,486
Anyway, we all know the government's liars and we all know NASA's liars and we all know it's a massive laundering money laundering scheme

195
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:55,418
Just like all the other shit.

196
00:06:55,961 --> 00:07:00,246
How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA and then filter back through

197
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,026
Different spiffs and perks and donations and funding

198
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:08,481
Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do like any real like, you know, crazy

199
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:12,061
shit like, you know, like if they fuck with like any aliens or something and you know

200
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,382
what I'm saying, like that maybe is the front.

201
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:17,381
Like it's a front for something like I'm a firm believer that I just said what it was

202
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,382
a front for.

203
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:19,941
It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.

204
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:22,901
Yeah, but like I think originally like the whole reason we even did that was to like

205
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:27,341
fucking, you know, funnel the money and recover up the fucking Cold War and shit, you know.

206
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:29,457
the beat the Russians, you know.

207
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:32,337
Well, that was the that was the original motivation.

208
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:33,090
Yeah.

209
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,697
But we didn't nobody went.

210
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:35,128
That's right.

211
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,297
Nobody fucking went, bro.

212
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:40,457
They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.

213
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:41,208
That or that.

214
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,097
I mean, that's that's what that was a basis of.

215
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:43,465
Yeah.

216
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,857
Race to the moon.

217
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:45,950
Yeah.

218
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,297
We beat you.

219
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:49,310
I hear it Arizona.

220
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,497
You might as well stop.

221
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:53,848
Yeah man, it is what it is man.

222
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:57,007
But guys, hope you're ready for a show.

223
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,768
Remember if you wanted to see any of these

224
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:01,767
Pitches, Articles, Links videos, go to AndyFosella.com.

225
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,208
You wanna make people real mad?

226
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,048
What?

227
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:05,768
You tell them that the earth isn't flat.

228
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:08,088
Oh fuck, now hold it, now you listen.

229
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,288
Them flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.

230
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,968
No listen, I mean, there's an argument.

231
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:13,808
No there's not.

232
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:15,248
There's no argument bro.

233
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,488
We've been up in planes, what does it look like?

234
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:22,935
You've seen what I've seen.

235
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,855
I'm just saying, bro, 40,000 you

236
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,095
will stick the earth flat.

237
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,295
Joe does Joe.

238
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:31,175
Joe Young does.

239
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:32,375
I know Joe Young does.

240
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:32,657
Yeah, bro.

241
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:33,535
We're ice shelfers.

242
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:36,175
You think I think I shelf could be true.

243
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:39,094
No, I just for it's true than the earth's flat.

244
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:39,696
I think I.

245
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:41,255
That's no.

246
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:42,056
Yeah.

247
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:45,294
No, ice shelf theory is not about flat earth.

248
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,158
It's about I'm not saying it is I'm saying if that is true though, then it would have to be no

249
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:52,281
There's still going to be some curvature.

250
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,818
It's like a fishbowl because you know

251
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:56,998
It's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head

252
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:01,778
Like you if you just drew a little circle on your hat you wore one of them little hats

253
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:07,198
You know those little tiny ones on your head which the the pointy ones or the no the little ones

254
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:09,658
You know those little round hats

255
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:16,417
A condom, any way he talking about like a fucking way,

256
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,337
kind of hat on the head.

257
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:20,738
All right.

258
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:22,498
Anyway.

259
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:25,177
Yeah man, hey listen, go to 80.com.

260
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:26,697
Go to 804Seller.com.

261
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,780
I wonder what it takes you to Andy.com.

262
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,181
Is that a real thing?

263
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,620
Let's get into our headlines, man.

264
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,100
We've got some some interesting stuff.

265
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,220
Let's start with first first series of headlines.

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,620
Had on number one, I wanted to get into this and this may be some foreshadowing

267
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,584
going on.

268
00:09:42,705 --> 00:09:47,300
I don't know, but I saw it and I immediately felt that this is not good.

269
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:52,216
So JD Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.

270
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:57,496
And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation

271
00:09:57,475 --> 00:10:00,361
shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.

272
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:00,745
Right.

273
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:01,976
Like that's a typical security

274
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:02,278
thing.

275
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:02,621
Right.

276
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,847
I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.

277
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:06,936
We post it after

278
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,050
on the fucking plane ride home.

279
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:08,739
You know what I'm saying?

280
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,834
Like that's a typical thing.

281
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:09,976
Right.

282
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:16,055
And so JD Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.

283
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:27,822
And before he even got there, I don't know if you guys saw this, there was some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.

284
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:29,365
All right.

285
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:31,437
Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?

286
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,582
Well, if you got, I mean, first of all, people don't understand.

287
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,568
The level of logistics it has to go into,

288
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:41,527
organizing even a couple of hundred people together

289
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,767
at the same time to get them into a specific location

290
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:46,088
ahead of time.

291
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:48,948
This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail

292
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,448
that needs to be removed.

293
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:52,339
There's no way, there's no way.

294
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,539
That's not, like, how would they know

295
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:55,979
that information ahead of time?

296
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,099
To even organize 500 fucking people in there.

297
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,899
Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.

298
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,339
Leaking that shit out, bro.

299
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:05,539
And like I said, it wasn't, like, it wasn't a couple, bro.

300
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:06,859
It was a shit ton of them.

301
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:07,699
Yeah.

302
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,219
Vance is a trader, go ski in Russia.

303
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:13,659
Vance equals Putin's pawn equals trader.

304
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:15,059
So dude, these people,

305
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:22,710
think that Putin is the problem all the while people are being arrested for making social

306
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,251
media posts all through Europe.

307
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,610
We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women and stabbing people and killing them

308
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,011
who aren't European.

309
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:37,374
Okay, we have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.

310
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:38,257
Okay.

311
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:42,814
And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already

312
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,135
happening going on around them.

313
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:44,617
Yeah, right.

314
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:47,014
Like, what do we, what are you guys fighting for?

315
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:54,174
You know, these people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the

316
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:59,174
media and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.

317
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,825
All right, and dude, did you see that comment I got from,

318
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,865
I told, did I show you that comment I got

319
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:08,305
from one of the people who follows me about-

320
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:09,146
The Ukraine shit?

321
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:09,986
Yeah.

322
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:10,826
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:12,505
He's like, Ukraine's a sovereign nation

324
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:16,865
and we as the most powerful country in the world

325
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:19,745
have a responsibility to stick up for countries

326
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:20,825
that can't defend themselves.

327
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,665
Well, let me stop you right there, homie.

328
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:23,506
No, we don't.

329
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:27,323
We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.

330
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:32,883
And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.

331
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:37,823
It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.

332
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:44,263
OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.

333
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,270
an actual war because of our involvement with NATO.

334
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,990
They're sending troops in.

335
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,390
They would rather blow up the entire world

336
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,030
than to have the truth about the entire fucking system

337
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,470
that oppresses citizens globally to come out

338
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,550
and how they do it.

339
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,830
Yeah, right, right.

340
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,910
But they're supposed to be the people of peace

341
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,510
and love and tolerance and here we are.

342
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,351
It's insane, dude.

343
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,351
One more three on the doorstep.

344
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,830
Yeah, for what reason?

345
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,671
For what reason?

346
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,511
Exactly.

347
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,351
What reason?

348
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,942
The only reason that these people all want this war,

349
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,742
I'm not talking about these morons.

350
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:22,782
I'm talking about the people who are actually

351
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:23,623
making the decisions.

352
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,463
Write the shit on paper to face it.

353
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:28,542
Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.

354
00:13:28,522 --> 00:13:29,942
The only reason they want to do that

355
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,782
is because they don't want the truth to come out

356
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:33,942
about how all these nations collaborate

357
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:36,022
to oppress the citizens of humanity.

358
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:36,863
Yep.

359
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,063
Yep, 100% man.

360
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:41,102
Like I saw this and I just foreshadowing, bro,

361
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:42,503
this is some dangerous shit.

362
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:46,263
And they definitely need to lock that shit in,

363
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,103
you know what I'm saying?

364
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:48,103
Because we've seen what happens

365
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,663
when you have leaks in your security team

366
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:52,303
twice now with Donald Trump.

367
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,623
I mean, fuck, JD Vance obviously being,

368
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:57,662
you know, an incumbent potential running candidate

369
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:58,583
for 2028.

370
00:13:58,562 --> 00:13:59,983
I mean, bro, like, I mean,

371
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:01,543
be a good way to get him out beforehand.

372
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:02,943
They got somebody fucking in this scene.

373
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:03,783
I'm telling you, I know.

374
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:04,623
100% they need to fucking lock it.

375
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:05,623
There's no doubt.

376
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,653
Maybe to watch it there.

377
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:10,626
Listen, this administration is still full with rats.

378
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:15,240
It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.

379
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:18,009
You know, it's still full of this.

380
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:18,230
Yeah.

381
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:18,761
Yeah.

382
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:23,939
Well, so what kicked off all of this, this, uh, you know, Putin nonsense.

383
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,939
We got to go back a couple of days to this, this, uh, this meeting that happened

384
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,219
with Trump, Vance and Zelensky of Ukraine.

385
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,639
Um, now I will say this, like, I mean, I, cause we got plenty of criticism

386
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:38,619
to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.

387
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,860
Look what these people call them, dude.

388
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,339
Protester held signed labeling, Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.

389
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:43,703
Yeah.

390
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,299
You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.

391
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:52,579
You don't know it and and and you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with

392
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:56,419
Polarizing viewpoints the same thing they did with racism.

393
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,219
Yeah, dude exactly now people are like well, you know what?

394
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:01,944
Black people do still shit.

395
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:07,024
Yeah, like, I mean, bro, that, no, you know what?

396
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:09,384
It's almost good that they do this

397
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:13,504
because they devalue their defense mechanism.

398
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:15,504
Well, their offense mechanism, right?

399
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,424
Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.

400
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:19,304
Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.

401
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,624
And that shit ain't working anymore.

402
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:21,664
No one cares.

403
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:24,424
And it just exposed how radical they are.

404
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:25,264
Yes.

405
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:26,104
And what the truth that they actually

406
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,144
are trying to push behind them.

407
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:27,984
Well, unfortunately,

408
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:31,826
Eventually also it brings to the surface the element

409
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,826
that they claim to want to suppress.

410
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:37,186
You know, when you call everybody racist

411
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:39,346
for 20 fucking years,

412
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:41,406
eventually they're like, yeah, you know what?

413
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:43,666
I am because I'm tired of getting called this

414
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,626
and this and this from you fuckers, fuck you.

415
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:46,666
Simply fuck you, right?

416
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,066
Yeah, like dude, and what happens is

417
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:52,846
you end up, they end up radicalizing people.

418
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,630
It works the opposite of what they want.

419
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,670
They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.

420
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,330
Normal people, you know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.

421
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,390
That's not good for society.

422
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,690
Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that,

423
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,590
you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.

424
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:12,893
Like.

425
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:17,096
I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.

426
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:20,856
And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that

427
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:24,616
because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks

428
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,337
about their own race.

429
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:30,456
And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,

430
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:33,696
I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.

431
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:36,536
So I never made my race my identity.

432
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:39,536
I never I never said, you know, I'm fucking proud to be white.

433
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:41,536
That was never a thing.

434
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:44,833
I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says,

435
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:50,433
do the content of their character, who they are, you know, and I think most people are like that.

436
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,353
And I think we're getting to a point where

437
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:58,843
You know, everybody's coming back to that and these people who are calling all the names are going to be ostracized.

438
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:00,243
Like nobody's listening to shit.

439
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:01,943
Oh, fucking Nazi.

440
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:07,843
Bro, you don't even know what you don't even know anything about the history of fucking Nazi movement.

441
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:13,643
You don't know anything of the history of World War One or World War Two or how the Federal Reserve was formed.

442
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:16,243
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

443
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:17,144
Period.

444
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,228
That's just it.

445
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:20,048
No, it's stupid.

446
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:20,888
They don't know.

447
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:23,447
And they use these fucking terms, dude.

448
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:24,947
I'm gonna tell you what, man.

449
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,227
I get called every name in the book now.

450
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:30,068
I don't care.

451
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:30,908
Yeah, I take it that way.

452
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:32,127
I mean, I like smile.

453
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:33,727
I wear them as badges of honor.

454
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,087
Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye

455
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,807
has got a fucking swastika t-shirt?

456
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:37,648
Yeah.

457
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,207
Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.

458
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:41,754
You know, and you guys can get mad about that all you want.

459
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:44,834
But he's forcing you to pay attention.

460
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,394
And then when you look at the symbol

461
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:48,294
in the history of a swastika,

462
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:51,894
you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.

463
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:55,134
And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune

464
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:57,074
and prosperity through human history.

465
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:59,534
And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.

466
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,874
Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?

467
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:05,981
Do you think he used that to represent evil in his mind?

468
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,821
That's what he was he was before.

469
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,081
Yeah, he was in his mind.

470
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:13,221
He was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.

471
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:15,981
And then since then, that symbol has been, you know,

472
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,241
you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.

473
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:21,141
Well, bro, if you go to eastern cultures, it's everywhere.

474
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,054
It's on the buildings.

475
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,041
It's it's I mean, it's still.

476
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:24,783
Is that not true?

477
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:25,442
Say it.

478
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:26,064
It's right.

479
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:26,542
Yeah.

480
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,742
So like.

481
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:34,188
You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.

482
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:34,490
No

483
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,792
It's like and dude, let's pay attention.

484
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:39,931
Who are let's who are these people?

485
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,636
Who are they?

486
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:43,105
What race are they?

487
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:44,534
Oh, they're all white.

488
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:47,010
They're all white and what gender are they?

489
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,611
No, all women and what age are they?

490
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:53,039
Uh, I mean, they're brunch or age for sure.

491
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:54,739
And and what are they wearing?

492
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,239
Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking

493
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,439
Canada goose, $400 jackets.

494
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:00,439
Right, right.

495
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:01,439
Hmm.

496
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:02,939
Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably.

497
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:04,139
These motherfuckers listen to you.

498
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:05,539
They got laid off from USAID.

499
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:06,939
Yeah, no, for sure.

500
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,439
Listen, that group, this group of people.

501
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:15,737
is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because

502
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:21,417
they are so privileged they don't have any worries they fucking live in upper middle class areas and

503
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:27,257
they drink champagne on Sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and because they don't

504
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:32,457
have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to seem virtuous and care

505
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:37,417
stand up for the fucking right thing the thing you go actually go to Ukraine go fight and fucking

506
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:38,258
Can you create anything?

507
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:39,457
I don't want to hear it, dude.

508
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,453
I don't give a fuck.

509
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:41,117
You know what?

510
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:42,182
I'm America first.

511
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:43,228
Period.

512
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:47,188
I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel or anybody else.

513
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:49,198
Here first, then there.

514
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:55,428
And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.

515
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:56,414
Doesn't matter who it is.

516
00:19:57,199 --> 00:20:02,128
And by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.

517
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,128
No.

518
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:05,640
Makes sense to me, man.

519
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:07,351
But guys, let's slow this down.

520
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:10,752
Let's let's let's talk about how we even got to, you know, having you know,

521
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:13,233
why the you know, why the United States funds all these countries?

522
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:14,840
Do you know why?

523
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,153
Because we have to know that's not why.

524
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:21,146
United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.

525
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:25,186
They go and have a golden handcuffed these these countries.

526
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:25,928
Okay.

527
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:29,126
So they either say, Hey, we'll give you this aid, but you can't make this and

528
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:31,846
this and this and this and this as part of the agreement, right?

529
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,726
Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.

530
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:37,486
Or they give them the money knowing that.

531
00:20:37,998 --> 00:20:42,658
the United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation and

532
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:43,386
prosperity.

533
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,338
Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.

534
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:47,770
It's no different than a rich kid.

535
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:51,258
OK, you got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep

536
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:54,138
giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep

537
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:54,663
giving him money.

538
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:58,338
Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?

539
00:20:58,878 --> 00:21:01,158
Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.

540
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,458
OK, if you keep foreign aiding,

541
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:03,804
to cut.

542
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,858
What I'm saying here is that

543
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,600
We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally and it needs to fucking stop.

544
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,208
Yeah, bro.

545
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,282
Take them off the tee, bro.

546
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:13,720
Make them learn how to get the food themselves.

547
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,390
Get strong or get conquered.

548
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:17,759
I don't give a fuck.

549
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:18,705
I don't care.

550
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,114
I'm American, bro.

551
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:21,000
I care about us

552
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,444
first.

553
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:23,361
Do I care about people in Europe?

554
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,491
Yeah, I got friends in Europe.

555
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:25,560
Do I care about people in

556
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,043
Australia?

557
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:26,607
Yeah, I do.

558
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,527
Do I care about them more than us?

559
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,695
No, sorry, I don't.

560
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:31,400
I care about us.

561
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,560
Yeah, so 100% bro.

562
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,040
But yeah, let's slow this down.

563
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:37,600
Let's see where this all started.

564
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,600
Cause we gotta go back a couple of days to a meeting

565
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:42,999
that Trump Vance and Zelinski had at the White House.

566
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:45,319
And this was the first time we got to really see

567
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,120
any type of negotiations, I guess,

568
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,720
with the press corps being there.

569
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:51,356
Which I believe was part of Trump's play.

570
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:52,356
I mean, obviously.

571
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:57,955
Because, apparently, word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind

572
00:21:57,935 --> 00:21:58,956
cameras.

573
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:03,516
And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see us through color.

574
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:04,636
So let's check this clip out.

575
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,980
I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.

576
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,981
Yes, but if you are not strong...

577
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,260
Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try

578
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,580
to litigate this in front of the American media.

579
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,080
Right now you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you

580
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,820
have manpower problems.

581
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,940
You should be thanking the President to bring it into this conflict.

582
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,780
Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?

583
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:39,803
I have been to come once I have actually I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people you bring them on a propaganda tour Mr. President.

584
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:46,043
Are do you disagree that you've had problems with bringing people in your military and do you think that it's respectful.

585
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:53,243
I will answer to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to try to prevent the destruction of your.

586
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:54,916
A lot of questions.

587
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:56,529
Let's start from the beginning.

588
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,243
First of all, during the war...

589
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:06,334
Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future

590
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,695
God bless you

591
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:12,475
Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother.

592
00:23:12,496 --> 00:23:13,143
That was a threat.

593
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:13,790
Hold on.

594
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:14,174
Stop it

595
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:19,694
That was a fucking 100 that was a fucking threat 100 percent

596
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:25,649
fuck this little motherfucker, throw him in the fucking wood chipper, right there, and

597
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:26,474
the war ends.

598
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:28,851
Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.

599
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:31,329
This motherfucker wants the war because

600
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:35,329
him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.

601
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,500
Okay, but that was a fucking diary, bro.

602
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,740
You're sitting in the oval office.

603
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,499
What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is.

604
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:42,125
Immediately?

605
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,500
No.

606
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,580
I love how Trump's sitting.

607
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,500
He's letting them talk.

608
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:44,822
Yeah.

609
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,699
Let's him talk, let's him talk, let's him talk, let's him talk.

610
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,019
The guy gets one inch out of line and he says,

611
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:52,259
Oh, hold on.

612
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:53,260
And then let's play the rest.

613
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,460
Fucking hammers him, bro.

614
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,820
Tell us what we're going to feel.

615
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,740
I'm not telling you.

616
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,819
Because you're in no position to dictate that.

617
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,860
Remember this.

618
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,979
You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

619
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:06,484
You will feel influenced.

620
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:10,484
I'm telling you, you will feel influenced.

621
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,484
You're right now not in a very good position.

622
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:15,484
You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position.

623
00:24:15,463 --> 00:24:17,484
And it happens to be right about you.

624
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:20,484
From the very beginning of the war, Mr. Rahab, I was...

625
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:21,402
You're not in a good position.

626
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:22,484
You don't have the cards right now.

627
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,321
With us you start having cars.

628
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,321
But right now you don't have your plane cars.

629
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,321
You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

630
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,321
You're gambling with World War III.

631
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,321
You're gambling with World War III.

632
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,321
And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.

633
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,792
It's back to you.

634
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:46,321
Far more than a lot of people said they should have.

635
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,496
a lot of times.

636
00:24:48,475 --> 00:24:49,896
No, even today.

637
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,196
Even today.

638
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:55,136
You went to Pennsylvania and campaign for the opposition in October,

639
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:58,936
offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America,

640
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:02,436
and the president who's trying to save your country.

641
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:04,696
And your life.

642
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:07,062
Look, dude, he's dead anyway.

643
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:08,262
Let him kill this dude.

644
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:10,422
Listen, either side's going to do it.

645
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:10,983
Yeah, for sure.

646
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:11,703
He's getting killed.

647
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:12,822
This guy's fucking done.

648
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,822
They can't let that dude walk, like knowing what he knows, bro.

649
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:16,782
No, not only that.

650
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:17,663
No, he stole.

651
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:18,942
Dude, he knows where all the money went.

652
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:20,662
He knows exactly where it went.

653
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:21,303
You know what I'm saying?

654
00:25:21,282 --> 00:25:23,502
They can't let that dude walk.

655
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:24,909
Yeah, see, you know, we call it how we see it.

656
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:30,409
A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset.

657
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:33,749
I saw this, like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American.

658
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:38,189
I'm so dis, listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters.

659
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:38,711
Okay.

660
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:39,390
Real talk.

661
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,530
You've never had to fight for anything.

662
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:43,710
You've never had to negotiate for anything.

663
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:50,029
This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men.

664
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:50,811
Okay.

665
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,147
When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.

666
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:56,107
And that's what Trump does.

667
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,347
He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.

668
00:25:59,327 --> 00:26:01,147
He just threatened our country, bro.

669
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:01,437
Oh, dude.

670
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,387
And we got people.

671
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,747
And what are we going to feel?

672
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:04,567
Brother, we don't help.

673
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:05,427
Wait, brother.

674
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:08,227
First of all, we got people in this country

675
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:10,587
that fucking are on his side.

676
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:14,613
Like bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.

677
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:15,874
Go over there.

678
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:16,854
Go live in Europe.

679
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:17,854
Go live in Ukraine.

680
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:18,414
They'll take you.

681
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,573
And then they'll take you to the front lines.

682
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:25,753
Like they're taking people with down syndrome to the front fucking lines.

683
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,154
Bro, I saw that clip.

684
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:30,913
All you motherfuckers talking all this shit, you don't know what you're talking about, dude.

685
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,214
You have no idea.

686
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:33,653
You haven't been paying attention.

687
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,353
You're sucked into your own life.

688
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:39,293
You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.

689
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,835
And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.

690
00:26:42,815 --> 00:26:44,235
You know what?

691
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:46,835
You weren't embarrassed when our country was run

692
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,675
by a literal vegetable.

693
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,335
You weren't embarrassed when...

694
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:53,976
They stole all your money and closed your businesses

695
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:55,736
and fucked with you.

696
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,696
You weren't embarrassed when our whole country

697
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:01,116
is a laughing stock of the entire world

698
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:04,256
because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons

699
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:05,336
running our country.

700
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:06,496
Trans titties on the front line.

701
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:09,936
Bro, we got trans generals and we got kids,

702
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:11,896
we're promoting kids cutting off their dick

703
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,096
and everybody else in the world is like.

704
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:16,713
the fuck is going on in the US?

705
00:27:16,693 --> 00:27:18,753
You weren't embarrassed about that shit,

706
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:20,793
but you're embarrassed about this man

707
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,313
and this other man who have finally said,

708
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:26,993
no, you're not gonna fucking do this shit here.

709
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:30,233
Okay, I actually thought, in my opinion,

710
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:34,033
that was the coolest, baddest ass, gangster ass shit

711
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:35,713
that I've ever seen from either one of those guys.

712
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:36,554
For sure, bro.

713
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:40,033
So if you don't like it and that's embarrassing to you,

714
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:42,013
then maybe you should fucking move.

715
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,308
Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.

716
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:48,548
And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls.

717
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:49,948
OK, I call it how I see it.

718
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:51,268
If he does good, he does good.

719
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:52,748
If he does bad, he does bad.

720
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:53,542
That's great.

721
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,579
That's not good.

722
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,108
That's great.

723
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:55,605
That's great.

724
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:56,269
OK.

725
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:58,348
This motherfucker stealing your money.

726
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:01,468
You guys are out here working and that's the problem.

727
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:03,908
A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.

728
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:04,438
They're not working.

729
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:04,629
Right.

730
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:08,308
So they don't get, they don't see that tax be taken out of their check

731
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:11,348
and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.

732
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,680
Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugatti's.

733
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,457
He's got two bucks.

734
00:28:18,621 --> 00:28:18,887
Yeah.

735
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:19,480
Damn.

736
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,560
Are they cool though?

737
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,320
I mean, you see a bad Bugatti.

738
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,860
Yeah, that's true.

739
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:24,400
That's fair.

740
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:27,326
I'm just saying, dude, like that's not, that's not okay.

741
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,926
No, it's cool for me to have to.

742
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:30,726
You know what I'm saying?

743
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,726
But I didn't, you know,

744
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,606
I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.

745
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:35,446
Exactly, exactly.

746
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:37,006
You know, like dude, fuck this guy.

747
00:28:36,985 --> 00:28:37,846
Yeah.

748
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:39,326
No, I mean, well, so this is what started

749
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:40,726
that whole chain of events, right?

750
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:42,126
So you got, I hate this motherfucker.

751
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:42,966
Oh, bro, I can't stand it.

752
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:44,846
And I can't stand people standing up for him.

753
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:47,366
It's so, it's stupid shit.

754
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:57,090
But after he left the oval office, he decided to go back to Europe and he did a little tour.

755
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,091
Did you hear what he said today about the, about our troops?

756
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,891
You got that clip?

757
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,091
I can put it in.

758
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,331
Bro, this guy gets on television today.

759
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,731
You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.

760
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:10,729
This guy gets on TV today.

761
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,090
Today is Monday.

762
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:14,090
Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.

763
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,930
And he fucking says,

764
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,129
the United States is gonna have to send his sons and daughters

765
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:22,569
to fight in Ukraine and they will die.

766
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:25,449
That's what he said is almost verbatim exact quote.

767
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:29,769
Dude, if we send a single soldier over there,

768
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:32,129
like a single fucking soldier,

769
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,209
this administration is no different than any other one.

770
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,050
100%.

771
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,544
Yeah.

772
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,450
Yeah, 100%, man.

773
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:40,687
But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour

774
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,688
So he stopped to stop in the UK

775
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:44,742
He went to the UK first.

776
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:47,687
He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food they got over there

777
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:51,328
Gordon Ramsay's the only one else I make food over there

778
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:59,527
That's why he's so fucking famous bro, that's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's only one over there
