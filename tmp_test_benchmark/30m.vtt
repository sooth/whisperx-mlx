WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:04.599
sleeping on the floor.

00:04.578 --> 00:06.279
Now my jewelry box froze.

00:06.258 --> 00:07.919
Fuck a boat, fuck a stove.

00:07.898 --> 00:09.599
Counted millions in a cold.

00:09.578 --> 00:11.279
Bad bitch, boot it slow.

00:11.258 --> 00:12.919
Got her on bank row.

00:12.898 --> 00:13.759
Can't fold.

00:13.738 --> 00:14.599
Duss a note.

00:14.578 --> 00:16.959
Head shot, case closed.

00:16.938 --> 00:17.919
What is up, guys?

00:17.898 --> 00:18.839
It's Andy for Selling.

00:18.818 --> 00:20.119
This is the show for the real.

00:20.098 --> 00:21.719
Let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness,

00:21.698 --> 00:23.399
and delusions of modern society.

00:23.378 --> 00:25.479
And welcome to motherfucking reality, guys.

00:25.458 --> 00:29.399
Today, we have Andy and DJ.

00:29.528 --> 00:31.389
Cruz the motherfucking in there.

00:31.368 --> 00:32.229
That's what we're gonna do.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.549
That's what CTI stands for.

00:33.528 --> 00:35.229
It stands for Cruz the internet.

00:36.368 --> 00:38.549
I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.

00:38.528 --> 00:40.789
But what we do here is we put topics on the screen,

00:40.768 --> 00:43.709
we speculate on what's true and what's not true.

00:43.688 --> 00:46.309
And then we talk about how we the people

00:46.288 --> 00:47.469
have to solve these problems

00:47.448 --> 00:49.069
that all these knuckleheads create.

00:50.088 --> 00:52.109
Let's just get right into it.

00:52.088 --> 00:53.669
We don't run ads on the show.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.250
So we ask that you don't be a hoe.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.330
And you share the shell.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.170
There you go.

01:00.149 --> 01:01.010
Yep.

01:00.989 --> 01:02.130
You're looking good, man.

01:02.109 --> 01:03.210
Damn.

01:03.189 --> 01:05.649
Yeah, I saw you trying to start work out

01:05.629 --> 01:06.970
and I know what the fuck you're up to.

01:06.949 --> 01:07.810
What am I up to?

01:07.789 --> 01:10.569
Trying to fucking catch up and beat me.

01:10.549 --> 01:11.410
I can't let you.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.741
I can't let you.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.241
I got, I can't.

01:15.220 --> 01:16.381
Bro, you look good, man.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.221
Shit.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.041
You're looking good.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.261
I don't know if it might just be the sweater.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.661
I don't think it's the sweater though.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.501
Oh, it's my face.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.341
Fuck man.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.181
Like, hey.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.181
Yeah, what's up?

01:24.160 --> 01:25.021
You tell me.

01:25.000 --> 01:25.861
You look good too, bro.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.701
Thanks man.

01:26.680 --> 01:27.541
Pull me down.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.541
Yeah.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.861
We went to, we had a big event this weekend.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.501
Dude, that was a big historic event.

01:32.480 --> 01:33.341
Right.

01:35.898 --> 01:39.258
Big Jim turns 80 years old yesterday.

01:39.238 --> 01:40.099
Shit.

01:40.078 --> 01:41.698
We went to dinner on Saturday for a good time.

01:41.678 --> 01:42.539
It was good.

01:42.518 --> 01:43.379
It was a good time, man.

01:43.358 --> 01:44.219
It's always nice.

01:44.198 --> 01:45.059
It's always nice.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.818
He was kind of surprised.

01:47.798 --> 01:48.979
You know, he's been around, man.

01:48.958 --> 01:51.098
It's hard to get him.

01:51.423 --> 01:53.043
We've been around that many blocks.

01:53.023 --> 01:55.043
Yeah.

01:55.023 --> 01:59.043
I mean, he fought in the Civil War.

01:59.023 --> 01:59.545
He's seen it.

01:59.523 --> 02:00.045
He's seen it.

02:00.023 --> 02:01.244
Thank you to that's for sure.

02:01.223 --> 02:01.745
Yeah.

02:01.723 --> 02:02.245
Yeah.

02:02.223 --> 02:02.844
80 years.

02:02.823 --> 02:03.644
Fuck man.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.444
That's a long time.

02:04.423 --> 02:04.746
Yeah.

02:04.723 --> 02:05.644
Still moving though.

02:05.623 --> 02:07.643
We ought to get them on the show maybe.

02:07.623 --> 02:09.643
I mean, if you have an interview of his 80 years.

02:09.623 --> 02:09.848
Yeah.

02:09.823 --> 02:12.043
If you guys are ready for a six hour podcast.

02:12.023 --> 02:12.644
Oh my God.

02:12.623 --> 02:13.844
Let us know.

02:13.823 --> 02:15.643
That's the truth.

02:15.623 --> 02:18.043
It's going to be an all day affair.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.267
What else going on?

02:19.246 --> 02:20.107
It'll be fucking good though, man.

02:20.086 --> 02:22.186
No, yeah, everything is good, man.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.187
You know, everything is good.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.026
We got a lot to talk about.

02:25.006 --> 02:25.867
I bet.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.666
Yeah, let's do some cruising.

02:28.646 --> 02:31.186
Before we get to our headlines,

02:31.166 --> 02:33.826
you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce

02:33.806 --> 02:34.667
in there for you.

02:35.886 --> 02:37.307
We just landed on the moon.

02:38.606 --> 02:39.467
Who did?

02:39.446 --> 02:40.387
We did.

02:40.366 --> 02:41.227
We mean you?

02:41.206 --> 02:42.307
No, like America.

02:42.286 --> 02:44.106
Oh, yeah, Lunalander.

02:44.832 --> 02:49.352
Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon.

02:49.332 --> 02:51.993
This is first time ever.

02:55.472 --> 02:58.752
How about I say, you know, I was going to say, you know, I would believe this

02:58.732 --> 02:59.653
when chicks can grow.

02:59.632 --> 03:02.652
You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.753
You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah.

03:05.832 --> 03:07.953
And be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real.

03:07.932 --> 03:08.255
Like.

03:09.892 --> 03:11.312
You just can't.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.153
If you do,

03:14.172 --> 03:17.272
I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.

03:17.252 --> 03:18.113
Bro.

03:23.212 --> 03:25.272
You just can't tell me that's real, I'm sorry.

03:25.252 --> 03:28.192
Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.

03:28.172 --> 03:29.033
You know what I'm saying?

03:29.012 --> 03:30.712
Well, apparently they can.

03:30.692 --> 03:32.272
Well, one's more true than the other though.

03:32.252 --> 03:33.113
Yeah.

03:33.092 --> 03:33.953
Yeah.

03:33.932 --> 03:36.112
Did you see that study I said you?

03:36.301 --> 03:37.682
about, oh yeah, dude, that's sad.

03:37.661 --> 03:42.121
Bro, the, the, I said DJ has studied today and they said that, uh,

03:42.101 --> 03:45.761
they ran some studies on people who actually transition.

03:45.741 --> 03:50.561
So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they

03:50.701 --> 03:54.521
transition, they have a suicide, a likelihood suicide rate of, I think,

03:54.501 --> 03:55.462
like 48%.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.321
Right.

03:56.301 --> 03:58.321
And so doing the surgery saves their lives.

03:58.301 --> 04:00.801
Yes, that's the justification for these people.

04:00.781 --> 04:01.127
Right.

04:01.249 --> 04:03.201
Now there's been a study that's come out.

04:03.638 --> 04:07.259
Does this say a recent study published in Oxford's?

04:07.678 --> 04:08.819
Yeah, we know Oxford.

04:08.798 --> 04:09.899
They don't know what they're doing.

04:09.878 --> 04:10.959
They trust science there.

04:10.938 --> 04:11.301
Yeah.

04:12.045 --> 04:17.959
Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people

04:18.238 --> 04:23.159
found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender

04:23.138 --> 04:25.299
dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.

04:25.278 --> 04:27.399
So it goes from 48 to 96.

04:28.778 --> 04:29.759
I ain't going mad.

04:29.738 --> 04:30.919
Yeah.

04:32.038 --> 04:32.099
So.

04:32.078 --> 04:33.219
He's counting, man.

04:33.198 --> 04:34.739
Yeah.

04:33.625 --> 04:42.405
I would have never guessed I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis that eventually you're gonna regret it

04:42.385 --> 04:43.272
It has a problem.

04:43.352 --> 04:48.025
I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts eventually you're going to regret it

04:48.005 --> 04:50.426
I would have never guessed if you

04:51.305 --> 04:58.685
So'd your vagina shut and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis that I would regret that

04:58.665 --> 05:02.086
I mean who would have known who would have known

05:03.342 --> 05:04.203
I mean, I'm shocked.

05:04.182 --> 05:07.282
Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.

05:07.262 --> 05:08.963
First of all, it's a lot of cutting.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.643
All right, but second of all.

05:10.622 --> 05:12.363
Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.

05:12.342 --> 05:14.323
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

05:14.302 --> 05:15.163
Yeah.

05:15.142 --> 05:16.523
What did I miss?

05:16.502 --> 05:18.363
Wait, what did she say?

05:18.342 --> 05:19.203
What did she say?

05:19.182 --> 05:20.203
I don't know, she said something.

05:20.182 --> 05:21.043
I can't say it.

05:21.022 --> 05:22.243
I'll call her ass right now.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.083
Yeah.

05:22.664 --> 05:29.884
Um, no, I mean, but it makes sense.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.885
Well, you can't just do that shit, man.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.525
Like, and here's the thing.

05:33.504 --> 05:35.245
It's common sense, bro.

05:35.224 --> 05:35.743
It is.

05:35.764 --> 05:36.325
But here's the thing.

05:36.304 --> 05:39.044
This is a relatively new thing in our society.

05:39.024 --> 05:41.164
And the problem is, is that they were able to

05:41.144 --> 05:43.125
spout all of these justifications.

05:43.264 --> 05:46.644
There wasn't enough time for these type of studies to even come through.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.165
You got to follow that shit out.

05:48.584 --> 05:51.324
It takes some time to get a good base of evidence there.

05:51.790 --> 05:56.811
And yeah, so I mean it makes sense, but yeah, so I mean chicks with dicks is more possible than going to the moon though

05:56.790 --> 05:58.491
Yeah, yeah

05:58.470 --> 06:02.780
The funniest thing about this though real quick is so you know buzz buzz Aldrin.

06:03.304 --> 06:04.210
I didn't know he was still alive

06:04.190 --> 06:05.137
He's alive.

06:05.740 --> 06:10.330
Is he and they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time

06:16.510 --> 06:18.531
Come on, that's fake too

06:20.174 --> 06:22.195
Conch you've been snare

06:32.894 --> 06:35.034
He's like shit, so that's what it really looks like

06:36.614 --> 06:39.754
Here's a picture they supplied this is supposed to be who took the picture

06:42.774 --> 06:44.795
Oh, yeah

06:46.246 --> 06:53.486
Anyway, we all know the government's liars and we all know NASA's liars and we all know it's a massive laundering money laundering scheme

06:53.466 --> 06:55.418
Just like all the other shit.

06:55.961 --> 07:00.246
How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA and then filter back through

07:01.366 --> 07:04.026
Different spiffs and perks and donations and funding

07:04.201 --> 07:08.481
Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do like any real like, you know, crazy

07:08.461 --> 07:12.061
shit like, you know, like if they fuck with like any aliens or something and you know

07:12.041 --> 07:13.382
what I'm saying, like that maybe is the front.

07:13.361 --> 07:17.381
Like it's a front for something like I'm a firm believer that I just said what it was

07:17.361 --> 07:18.382
a front for.

07:18.361 --> 07:19.941
It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.

07:19.921 --> 07:22.901
Yeah, but like I think originally like the whole reason we even did that was to like

07:22.881 --> 07:27.341
fucking, you know, funnel the money and recover up the fucking Cold War and shit, you know.

07:27.877 --> 07:29.457
the beat the Russians, you know.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.337
Well, that was the that was the original motivation.

07:32.317 --> 07:33.090
Yeah.

07:33.110 --> 07:34.697
But we didn't nobody went.

07:34.677 --> 07:35.128
That's right.

07:35.251 --> 07:36.297
Nobody fucking went, bro.

07:36.277 --> 07:40.457
They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.

07:40.437 --> 07:41.208
That or that.

07:41.310 --> 07:43.097
I mean, that's that's what that was a basis of.

07:43.077 --> 07:43.465
Yeah.

07:43.670 --> 07:44.857
Race to the moon.

07:44.837 --> 07:45.950
Yeah.

07:45.970 --> 07:48.297
We beat you.

07:48.277 --> 07:49.310
I hear it Arizona.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.497
You might as well stop.

07:52.227 --> 07:53.848
Yeah man, it is what it is man.

07:53.827 --> 07:57.007
But guys, hope you're ready for a show.

07:56.987 --> 07:58.768
Remember if you wanted to see any of these

08:01.747 --> 08:03.208
You wanna make people real mad?

08:03.187 --> 08:04.048
What?

08:04.027 --> 08:05.768
You tell them that the earth isn't flat.

08:05.747 --> 08:08.088
Oh fuck, now hold it, now you listen.

08:08.067 --> 08:10.288
Them flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.

08:10.267 --> 08:12.968
No listen, I mean, there's an argument.

08:12.947 --> 08:13.808
No there's not.

08:13.787 --> 08:15.248
There's no argument bro.

08:15.227 --> 08:17.488
We've been up in planes, what does it look like?

08:21.674 --> 08:22.935
You've seen what I've seen.

08:24.954 --> 08:26.855
I'm just saying, bro, 40,000 you

08:26.834 --> 08:28.095
will stick the earth flat.

08:29.034 --> 08:30.295
Joe does Joe.

08:30.314 --> 08:31.175
Joe Young does.

08:31.154 --> 08:32.375
I know Joe Young does.

08:32.354 --> 08:32.657
Yeah, bro.

08:32.634 --> 08:33.535
We're ice shelfers.

08:34.234 --> 08:36.175
You think I think I shelf could be true.

08:36.194 --> 08:39.094
No, I just for it's true than the earth's flat.

08:39.114 --> 08:39.696
I think I.

08:40.434 --> 08:41.255
That's no.

08:41.474 --> 08:42.056
Yeah.

08:42.034 --> 08:45.294
No, ice shelf theory is not about flat earth.

08:46.278 --> 08:50.158
It's about I'm not saying it is I'm saying if that is true though, then it would have to be no

08:50.138 --> 08:52.281
There's still going to be some curvature.

08:52.625 --> 08:53.818
It's like a fishbowl because you know

08:53.798 --> 08:56.998
It's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head

08:58.098 --> 09:01.778
Like you if you just drew a little circle on your hat you wore one of them little hats

09:01.758 --> 09:07.198
You know those little tiny ones on your head which the the pointy ones or the no the little ones

09:07.478 --> 09:09.658
You know those little round hats

09:13.717 --> 09:16.417
A condom, any way he talking about like a fucking way,

09:16.397 --> 09:18.337
kind of hat on the head.

09:19.877 --> 09:20.738
All right.

09:21.637 --> 09:22.498
Anyway.

09:22.477 --> 09:25.177
Yeah man, hey listen, go to 80.com.

09:25.157 --> 09:26.697
Go to 804Seller.com.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.780
I wonder what it takes you to Andy.com.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.181
Is that a real thing?

09:31.280 --> 09:32.620
Let's get into our headlines, man.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.100
We've got some some interesting stuff.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.220
Let's start with first first series of headlines.

09:37.200 --> 09:41.620
Had on number one, I wanted to get into this and this may be some foreshadowing

09:41.960 --> 09:42.584
going on.

09:42.705 --> 09:47.300
I don't know, but I saw it and I immediately felt that this is not good.

09:47.635 --> 09:52.216
So JD Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.

09:53.395 --> 09:57.496
And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation

09:57.475 --> 10:00.361
shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.

10:00.583 --> 10:00.745
Right.

10:00.765 --> 10:01.976
Like that's a typical security

10:01.955 --> 10:02.278
thing.

10:02.399 --> 10:02.621
Right.

10:03.286 --> 10:05.847
I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.

10:05.867 --> 10:06.936
We post it after

10:06.915 --> 10:08.050
on the fucking plane ride home.

10:08.111 --> 10:08.739
You know what I'm saying?

10:08.760 --> 10:09.834
Like that's a typical thing.

10:09.854 --> 10:09.976
Right.

10:10.755 --> 10:16.055
And so JD Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.

10:16.762 --> 10:27.822
And before he even got there, I don't know if you guys saw this, there was some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.

10:28.842 --> 10:29.365
All right.

10:29.385 --> 10:31.437
Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?

10:31.880 --> 10:35.582
Well, if you got, I mean, first of all, people don't understand.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.568
The level of logistics it has to go into,

10:38.547 --> 10:41.527
organizing even a couple of hundred people together

10:41.507 --> 10:44.767
at the same time to get them into a specific location

10:44.747 --> 10:46.088
ahead of time.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.948
This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail

10:48.927 --> 10:50.448
that needs to be removed.

10:50.798 --> 10:52.339
There's no way, there's no way.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.539
That's not, like, how would they know

10:54.518 --> 10:55.979
that information ahead of time?

10:55.958 --> 10:58.099
To even organize 500 fucking people in there.

10:58.078 --> 11:01.899
Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.339
Leaking that shit out, bro.

11:03.318 --> 11:05.539
And like I said, it wasn't, like, it wasn't a couple, bro.

11:05.518 --> 11:06.859
It was a shit ton of them.

11:06.838 --> 11:07.699
Yeah.

11:07.678 --> 11:10.219
Vance is a trader, go ski in Russia.

11:10.198 --> 11:13.659
Vance equals Putin's pawn equals trader.

11:13.638 --> 11:15.059
So dude, these people,

11:15.790 --> 11:22.710
think that Putin is the problem all the while people are being arrested for making social

11:22.690 --> 11:25.251
media posts all through Europe.

11:25.230 --> 11:30.610
We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women and stabbing people and killing them

11:30.590 --> 11:32.011
who aren't European.

11:32.834 --> 11:37.374
Okay, we have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.

11:37.914 --> 11:38.257
Okay.

11:38.234 --> 11:42.814
And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already

11:42.794 --> 11:44.135
happening going on around them.

11:44.234 --> 11:44.617
Yeah, right.

11:44.594 --> 11:47.014
Like, what do we, what are you guys fighting for?

11:48.034 --> 11:54.174
You know, these people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the

11:54.154 --> 11:59.174
media and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.825
All right, and dude, did you see that comment I got from,

12:03.805 --> 12:05.865
I told, did I show you that comment I got

12:05.845 --> 12:08.305
from one of the people who follows me about-

12:08.285 --> 12:09.146
The Ukraine shit?

12:09.125 --> 12:09.986
Yeah.

12:09.965 --> 12:10.826
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:10.805 --> 12:12.505
He's like, Ukraine's a sovereign nation

12:12.485 --> 12:16.865
and we as the most powerful country in the world

12:16.845 --> 12:19.745
have a responsibility to stick up for countries

12:19.725 --> 12:20.825
that can't defend themselves.

12:20.805 --> 12:22.665
Well, let me stop you right there, homie.

12:22.645 --> 12:23.506
No, we don't.

12:23.763 --> 12:27.323
We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.

12:27.563 --> 12:32.883
And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.

12:33.103 --> 12:37.823
It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.

12:38.443 --> 12:44.263
OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.

12:45.650 --> 12:49.270
an actual war because of our involvement with NATO.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.990
They're sending troops in.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.390
They would rather blow up the entire world

12:53.370 --> 12:58.030
than to have the truth about the entire fucking system

12:58.010 --> 13:01.470
that oppresses citizens globally to come out

13:01.450 --> 13:02.550
and how they do it.

13:02.530 --> 13:03.830
Yeah, right, right.

13:03.810 --> 13:05.910
But they're supposed to be the people of peace

13:05.890 --> 13:08.510
and love and tolerance and here we are.

13:08.490 --> 13:09.351
It's insane, dude.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.351
One more three on the doorstep.

13:10.330 --> 13:11.830
Yeah, for what reason?

13:11.810 --> 13:12.671
For what reason?

13:12.650 --> 13:13.511
Exactly.

13:13.490 --> 13:14.351
What reason?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.942
The only reason that these people all want this war,

13:17.922 --> 13:19.742
I'm not talking about these morons.

13:19.722 --> 13:22.782
I'm talking about the people who are actually

13:22.762 --> 13:23.623
making the decisions.

13:23.602 --> 13:24.463
Write the shit on paper to face it.

13:24.442 --> 13:28.542
Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.

13:28.522 --> 13:29.942
The only reason they want to do that

13:29.922 --> 13:31.782
is because they don't want the truth to come out

13:31.762 --> 13:33.942
about how all these nations collaborate

13:33.922 --> 13:36.022
to oppress the citizens of humanity.

13:36.002 --> 13:36.863
Yep.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.063
Yep, 100% man.

13:38.042 --> 13:41.102
Like I saw this and I just foreshadowing, bro,

13:41.082 --> 13:42.503
this is some dangerous shit.

13:43.802 --> 13:46.263
And they definitely need to lock that shit in,

13:46.242 --> 13:47.103
you know what I'm saying?

13:47.082 --> 13:48.103
Because we've seen what happens

13:48.082 --> 13:50.663
when you have leaks in your security team

13:50.642 --> 13:52.303
twice now with Donald Trump.

13:52.282 --> 13:54.623
I mean, fuck, JD Vance obviously being,

13:54.602 --> 13:57.662
you know, an incumbent potential running candidate

13:57.642 --> 13:58.583
for 2028.

13:58.562 --> 13:59.983
I mean, bro, like, I mean,

13:59.962 --> 14:01.543
be a good way to get him out beforehand.

14:01.522 --> 14:02.943
They got somebody fucking in this scene.

14:02.922 --> 14:03.783
I'm telling you, I know.

14:03.762 --> 14:04.623
100% they need to fucking lock it.

14:04.602 --> 14:05.623
There's no doubt.

14:05.570 --> 14:06.653
Maybe to watch it there.

14:06.874 --> 14:10.626
Listen, this administration is still full with rats.

14:11.208 --> 14:15.240
It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.

14:15.842 --> 14:18.009
You know, it's still full of this.

14:18.129 --> 14:18.230
Yeah.

14:18.479 --> 14:18.761
Yeah.

14:19.366 --> 14:23.939
Well, so what kicked off all of this, this, uh, you know, Putin nonsense.

14:23.919 --> 14:27.939
We got to go back a couple of days to this, this, uh, this meeting that happened

14:27.919 --> 14:31.219
with Trump, Vance and Zelensky of Ukraine.

14:31.639 --> 14:35.639
Um, now I will say this, like, I mean, I, cause we got plenty of criticism

14:35.619 --> 14:38.619
to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.

14:38.639 --> 14:39.860
Look what these people call them, dude.

14:39.839 --> 14:43.339
Protester held signed labeling, Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.

14:43.439 --> 14:43.703
Yeah.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.299
You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.

14:46.559 --> 14:52.579
You don't know it and and and you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with

14:53.599 --> 14:56.419
Polarizing viewpoints the same thing they did with racism.

14:56.439 --> 14:59.219
Yeah, dude exactly now people are like well, you know what?

15:00.683 --> 15:01.944
Black people do still shit.

15:01.923 --> 15:07.024
Yeah, like, I mean, bro, that, no, you know what?

15:07.003 --> 15:09.384
It's almost good that they do this

15:09.363 --> 15:13.504
because they devalue their defense mechanism.

15:13.483 --> 15:15.504
Well, their offense mechanism, right?

15:15.483 --> 15:17.424
Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.

15:17.403 --> 15:19.304
Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.

15:19.283 --> 15:20.624
And that shit ain't working anymore.

15:20.603 --> 15:21.664
No one cares.

15:21.643 --> 15:24.424
And it just exposed how radical they are.

15:24.403 --> 15:25.264
Yes.

15:25.243 --> 15:26.104
And what the truth that they actually

15:26.083 --> 15:27.144
are trying to push behind them.

15:27.123 --> 15:27.984
Well, unfortunately,

15:27.565 --> 15:31.826
Eventually also it brings to the surface the element

15:31.805 --> 15:33.826
that they claim to want to suppress.

15:34.805 --> 15:37.186
You know, when you call everybody racist

15:37.165 --> 15:39.346
for 20 fucking years,

15:39.325 --> 15:41.406
eventually they're like, yeah, you know what?

15:41.385 --> 15:43.666
I am because I'm tired of getting called this

15:43.645 --> 15:45.626
and this and this from you fuckers, fuck you.

15:45.605 --> 15:46.666
Simply fuck you, right?

15:46.645 --> 15:49.066
Yeah, like dude, and what happens is

15:49.045 --> 15:52.846
you end up, they end up radicalizing people.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.630
It works the opposite of what they want.

15:55.610 --> 15:59.670
They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.

15:59.650 --> 16:02.330
Normal people, you know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.

16:02.310 --> 16:04.390
That's not good for society.

16:04.370 --> 16:08.690
Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that,

16:08.910 --> 16:12.590
you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.

16:12.570 --> 16:12.893
Like.

16:13.516 --> 16:17.096
I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.

16:17.316 --> 16:20.856
And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that

16:21.076 --> 16:24.616
because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks

16:24.796 --> 16:26.337
about their own race.

16:26.316 --> 16:30.456
And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,

16:30.436 --> 16:33.696
I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.

16:33.996 --> 16:36.536
So I never made my race my identity.

16:36.516 --> 16:39.536
I never I never said, you know, I'm fucking proud to be white.

16:39.516 --> 16:41.536
That was never a thing.

16:41.613 --> 16:44.833
I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says,

16:44.813 --> 16:50.433
do the content of their character, who they are, you know, and I think most people are like that.

16:50.413 --> 16:52.353
And I think we're getting to a point where

16:53.223 --> 16:58.843
You know, everybody's coming back to that and these people who are calling all the names are going to be ostracized.

16:58.823 --> 17:00.243
Like nobody's listening to shit.

17:00.523 --> 17:01.943
Oh, fucking Nazi.

17:02.323 --> 17:07.843
Bro, you don't even know what you don't even know anything about the history of fucking Nazi movement.

17:08.023 --> 17:13.643
You don't know anything of the history of World War One or World War Two or how the Federal Reserve was formed.

17:13.823 --> 17:16.243
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

17:16.423 --> 17:17.144
Period.

17:18.367 --> 17:19.228
That's just it.

17:19.207 --> 17:20.048
No, it's stupid.

17:20.027 --> 17:20.888
They don't know.

17:20.867 --> 17:23.447
And they use these fucking terms, dude.

17:23.427 --> 17:24.947
I'm gonna tell you what, man.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.227
I get called every name in the book now.

17:29.207 --> 17:30.068
I don't care.

17:30.047 --> 17:30.908
Yeah, I take it that way.

17:30.887 --> 17:32.127
I mean, I like smile.

17:32.107 --> 17:33.727
I wear them as badges of honor.

17:33.707 --> 17:35.087
Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye

17:35.067 --> 17:36.807
has got a fucking swastika t-shirt?

17:36.787 --> 17:37.648
Yeah.

17:37.627 --> 17:39.207
Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.

17:39.173 --> 17:41.754
You know, and you guys can get mad about that all you want.

17:41.733 --> 17:44.834
But he's forcing you to pay attention.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.394
And then when you look at the symbol

17:46.373 --> 17:48.294
in the history of a swastika,

17:48.273 --> 17:51.894
you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.

17:51.873 --> 17:55.134
And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune

17:55.113 --> 17:57.074
and prosperity through human history.

17:57.053 --> 17:59.534
And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.874
Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?

18:01.921 --> 18:05.981
Do you think he used that to represent evil in his mind?

18:05.961 --> 18:07.821
That's what he was he was before.

18:07.801 --> 18:10.081
Yeah, he was in his mind.

18:10.061 --> 18:13.221
He was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.

18:13.201 --> 18:15.981
And then since then, that symbol has been, you know,

18:15.961 --> 18:18.241
you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.

18:18.661 --> 18:21.141
Well, bro, if you go to eastern cultures, it's everywhere.

18:21.121 --> 18:22.054
It's on the buildings.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.041
It's it's I mean, it's still.

18:24.021 --> 18:24.783
Is that not true?

18:25.112 --> 18:25.442
Say it.

18:25.421 --> 18:26.064
It's right.

18:26.085 --> 18:26.542
Yeah.

18:26.521 --> 18:27.742
So like.

18:28.870 --> 18:34.188
You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.

18:34.450 --> 18:34.490
No

18:35.270 --> 18:37.792
It's like and dude, let's pay attention.

18:37.832 --> 18:39.931
Who are let's who are these people?

18:40.790 --> 18:41.636
Who are they?

18:42.099 --> 18:43.105
What race are they?

18:43.951 --> 18:44.534
Oh, they're all white.

18:44.696 --> 18:47.010
They're all white and what gender are they?

18:46.990 --> 18:49.611
No, all women and what age are they?

18:50.318 --> 18:53.039
Uh, I mean, they're brunch or age for sure.

18:53.018 --> 18:54.739
And and what are they wearing?

18:54.718 --> 18:57.239
Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking

18:57.218 --> 18:59.439
Canada goose, $400 jackets.

18:59.418 --> 19:00.439
Right, right.

19:00.418 --> 19:01.439
Hmm.

19:01.418 --> 19:02.939
Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably.

19:02.918 --> 19:04.139
These motherfuckers listen to you.

19:04.118 --> 19:05.539
They got laid off from USAID.

19:05.518 --> 19:06.939
Yeah, no, for sure.

19:06.918 --> 19:09.439
Listen, that group, this group of people.

19:09.877 --> 19:15.737
is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because

19:15.717 --> 19:21.417
they are so privileged they don't have any worries they fucking live in upper middle class areas and

19:21.397 --> 19:27.257
they drink champagne on Sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and because they don't

19:27.237 --> 19:32.457
have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to seem virtuous and care

19:32.437 --> 19:37.417
stand up for the fucking right thing the thing you go actually go to Ukraine go fight and fucking

19:37.397 --> 19:38.258
Can you create anything?

19:38.237 --> 19:39.457
I don't want to hear it, dude.

19:39.408 --> 19:40.453
I don't give a fuck.

19:40.654 --> 19:41.117
You know what?

19:41.237 --> 19:42.182
I'm America first.

19:42.725 --> 19:43.228
Period.

19:43.489 --> 19:47.188
I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel or anybody else.

19:47.168 --> 19:49.198
Here first, then there.

19:49.238 --> 19:55.428
And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.

19:55.408 --> 19:56.414
Doesn't matter who it is.

19:57.199 --> 20:02.128
And by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.

20:02.108 --> 20:04.128
No.

20:04.332 --> 20:05.640
Makes sense to me, man.

20:05.801 --> 20:07.351
But guys, let's slow this down.

20:07.411 --> 20:10.752
Let's let's let's talk about how we even got to, you know, having you know,

20:10.732 --> 20:13.233
why the you know, why the United States funds all these countries?

20:14.252 --> 20:14.840
Do you know why?

20:14.881 --> 20:17.153
Because we have to know that's not why.

20:18.406 --> 20:21.146
United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.

20:21.826 --> 20:25.186
They go and have a golden handcuffed these these countries.

20:25.426 --> 20:25.928
Okay.

20:26.066 --> 20:29.126
So they either say, Hey, we'll give you this aid, but you can't make this and

20:29.106 --> 20:31.846
this and this and this and this as part of the agreement, right?

20:31.826 --> 20:33.726
Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.

20:34.226 --> 20:37.486
Or they give them the money knowing that.

20:37.998 --> 20:42.658
the United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation and

20:42.638 --> 20:43.386
prosperity.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.338
Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.

20:46.318 --> 20:47.770
It's no different than a rich kid.

20:48.274 --> 20:51.258
OK, you got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep

20:51.238 --> 20:54.138
giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep

20:54.118 --> 20:54.663
giving him money.

20:54.724 --> 20:58.338
Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?

20:58.878 --> 21:01.158
Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.

21:01.662 --> 21:03.458
OK, if you keep foreign aiding,

21:03.438 --> 21:03.804
to cut.

21:04.129 --> 21:05.858
What I'm saying here is that

21:06.500 --> 21:10.600
We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally and it needs to fucking stop.

21:10.580 --> 21:11.208
Yeah, bro.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.282
Take them off the tee, bro.

21:12.302 --> 21:13.720
Make them learn how to get the food themselves.

21:14.820 --> 21:16.390
Get strong or get conquered.

21:16.772 --> 21:17.759
I don't give a fuck.

21:18.121 --> 21:18.705
I don't care.

21:18.765 --> 21:20.114
I'm American, bro.

21:20.376 --> 21:21.000
I care about us

21:20.980 --> 21:21.444
first.

21:21.928 --> 21:23.361
Do I care about people in Europe?

21:23.381 --> 21:24.491
Yeah, I got friends in Europe.

21:24.591 --> 21:25.560
Do I care about people in

21:25.540 --> 21:26.043
Australia?

21:26.104 --> 21:26.607
Yeah, I do.

21:27.030 --> 21:29.527
Do I care about them more than us?

21:29.829 --> 21:30.695
No, sorry, I don't.

21:30.755 --> 21:31.400
I care about us.

21:32.099 --> 21:33.560
Yeah, so 100% bro.

21:34.659 --> 21:36.040
But yeah, let's slow this down.

21:36.019 --> 21:37.600
Let's see where this all started.

21:37.579 --> 21:39.600
Cause we gotta go back a couple of days to a meeting

21:39.579 --> 21:42.999
that Trump Vance and Zelinski had at the White House.

21:42.979 --> 21:45.319
And this was the first time we got to really see

21:45.299 --> 21:47.120
any type of negotiations, I guess,

21:47.099 --> 21:48.720
with the press corps being there.

21:48.535 --> 21:51.356
Which I believe was part of Trump's play.

21:51.335 --> 21:52.356
I mean, obviously.

21:52.335 --> 21:57.955
Because, apparently, word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind

21:57.935 --> 21:58.956
cameras.

21:58.935 --> 22:03.516
And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see us through color.

22:03.495 --> 22:04.636
So let's check this clip out.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.980
I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.981
Yes, but if you are not strong...

22:09.960 --> 22:14.260
Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try

22:14.240 --> 22:16.580
to litigate this in front of the American media.

22:16.560 --> 22:21.080
Right now you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you

22:21.060 --> 22:22.820
have manpower problems.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.940
You should be thanking the President to bring it into this conflict.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.780
Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?

22:29.103 --> 22:39.803
I have been to come once I have actually I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people you bring them on a propaganda tour Mr. President.

22:39.983 --> 22:46.043
Are do you disagree that you've had problems with bringing people in your military and do you think that it's respectful.

22:46.023 --> 22:53.243
I will answer to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to try to prevent the destruction of your.

22:53.223 --> 22:54.916
A lot of questions.

22:55.078 --> 22:56.529
Let's start from the beginning.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.243
First of all, during the war...

22:58.634 --> 23:06.334
Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future

23:07.674 --> 23:09.695
God bless you

23:10.554 --> 23:12.475
Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother.

23:12.496 --> 23:13.143
That was a threat.

23:13.365 --> 23:13.790
Hold on.

23:13.932 --> 23:14.174
Stop it

23:15.434 --> 23:19.694
That was a fucking 100 that was a fucking threat 100 percent

23:20.588 --> 23:25.649
fuck this little motherfucker, throw him in the fucking wood chipper, right there, and

23:25.628 --> 23:26.474
the war ends.

23:27.099 --> 23:28.851
Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.

23:29.516 --> 23:31.329
This motherfucker wants the war because

23:31.308 --> 23:35.329
him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.

23:35.759 --> 23:37.500
Okay, but that was a fucking diary, bro.

23:37.479 --> 23:38.740
You're sitting in the oval office.

23:38.719 --> 23:41.499
What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is.

23:41.479 --> 23:42.125
Immediately?

23:42.250 --> 23:42.500
No.

23:42.479 --> 23:43.580
I love how Trump's sitting.

23:43.559 --> 23:44.500
He's letting them talk.

23:44.479 --> 23:44.822
Yeah.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.699
Let's him talk, let's him talk, let's him talk, let's him talk.

23:47.679 --> 23:50.019
The guy gets one inch out of line and he says,

23:49.999 --> 23:52.259
Oh, hold on.

23:52.239 --> 23:53.260
And then let's play the rest.

23:53.239 --> 23:54.460
Fucking hammers him, bro.

23:54.439 --> 23:55.820
Tell us what we're going to feel.

23:55.799 --> 23:56.740
I'm not telling you.

23:56.719 --> 23:58.819
Because you're in no position to dictate that.

23:58.799 --> 23:59.860
Remember this.

23:59.839 --> 24:03.979
You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.

24:04.463 --> 24:06.484
You will feel influenced.

24:06.463 --> 24:10.484
I'm telling you, you will feel influenced.

24:10.463 --> 24:12.484
You're right now not in a very good position.

24:12.463 --> 24:15.484
You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position.

24:15.463 --> 24:17.484
And it happens to be right about you.

24:17.463 --> 24:20.484
From the very beginning of the war, Mr. Rahab, I was...

24:20.463 --> 24:21.402
You're not in a good position.

24:21.423 --> 24:22.484
You don't have the cards right now.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.321
With us you start having cars.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.321
But right now you don't have your plane cars.

24:26.300 --> 24:30.321
You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

24:30.300 --> 24:33.321
You're gambling with World War III.

24:33.300 --> 24:36.321
You're gambling with World War III.

24:36.300 --> 24:41.321
And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.

24:41.300 --> 24:42.792
It's back to you.

24:43.095 --> 24:46.321
Far more than a lot of people said they should have.

24:47.275 --> 24:48.496
a lot of times.

24:48.475 --> 24:49.896
No, even today.

24:49.875 --> 24:51.196
Even today.

24:51.175 --> 24:55.136
You went to Pennsylvania and campaign for the opposition in October,

24:55.115 --> 24:58.936
offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America,

24:58.915 --> 25:02.436
and the president who's trying to save your country.

25:03.675 --> 25:04.696
And your life.

25:05.602 --> 25:07.062
Look, dude, he's dead anyway.

25:07.042 --> 25:08.262
Let him kill this dude.

25:08.242 --> 25:10.422
Listen, either side's going to do it.

25:10.402 --> 25:10.983
Yeah, for sure.

25:10.962 --> 25:11.703
He's getting killed.

25:11.682 --> 25:12.822
This guy's fucking done.

25:12.802 --> 25:15.822
They can't let that dude walk, like knowing what he knows, bro.

25:15.802 --> 25:16.782
No, not only that.

25:16.762 --> 25:17.663
No, he stole.

25:17.642 --> 25:18.942
Dude, he knows where all the money went.

25:18.922 --> 25:20.662
He knows exactly where it went.

25:20.642 --> 25:21.303
You know what I'm saying?

25:21.282 --> 25:23.502
They can't let that dude walk.

25:22.409 --> 25:24.909
Yeah, see, you know, we call it how we see it.

25:25.169 --> 25:30.409
A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset.

25:30.389 --> 25:33.749
I saw this, like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American.

25:33.729 --> 25:38.189
I'm so dis, listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters.

25:38.309 --> 25:38.711
Okay.

25:38.689 --> 25:39.390
Real talk.

25:39.709 --> 25:41.530
You've never had to fight for anything.

25:41.689 --> 25:43.710
You've never had to negotiate for anything.

25:43.889 --> 25:50.029
This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men.

25:50.309 --> 25:50.811
Okay.

25:51.367 --> 25:54.147
When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.

25:54.527 --> 25:56.107
And that's what Trump does.

25:56.087 --> 25:59.347
He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.

25:59.327 --> 26:01.147
He just threatened our country, bro.

26:01.127 --> 26:01.437
Oh, dude.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.387
And we got people.

26:02.367 --> 26:03.747
And what are we going to feel?

26:03.727 --> 26:04.567
Brother, we don't help.

26:04.608 --> 26:05.427
Wait, brother.

26:05.407 --> 26:08.227
First of all, we got people in this country

26:08.207 --> 26:10.587
that fucking are on his side.

26:11.313 --> 26:14.613
Like bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.

26:15.093 --> 26:15.874
Go over there.

26:16.033 --> 26:16.854
Go live in Europe.

26:16.953 --> 26:17.854
Go live in Ukraine.

26:17.833 --> 26:18.414
They'll take you.

26:18.933 --> 26:20.573
And then they'll take you to the front lines.

26:20.773 --> 26:25.753
Like they're taking people with down syndrome to the front fucking lines.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.154
Bro, I saw that clip.

26:27.213 --> 26:30.913
All you motherfuckers talking all this shit, you don't know what you're talking about, dude.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.214
You have no idea.

26:32.193 --> 26:33.653
You haven't been paying attention.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.353
You're sucked into your own life.

26:35.533 --> 26:39.293
You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.835
And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.

26:42.815 --> 26:44.235
You know what?

26:44.215 --> 26:46.835
You weren't embarrassed when our country was run

26:46.815 --> 26:48.675
by a literal vegetable.

26:48.655 --> 26:50.335
You weren't embarrassed when...

26:51.475 --> 26:53.976
They stole all your money and closed your businesses

26:53.955 --> 26:55.736
and fucked with you.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.696
You weren't embarrassed when our whole country

26:57.675 --> 27:01.116
is a laughing stock of the entire world

27:01.095 --> 27:04.256
because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons

27:04.235 --> 27:05.336
running our country.

27:05.315 --> 27:06.496
Trans titties on the front line.

27:06.475 --> 27:09.936
Bro, we got trans generals and we got kids,

27:09.915 --> 27:11.896
we're promoting kids cutting off their dick

27:11.875 --> 27:14.096
and everybody else in the world is like.

27:14.493 --> 27:16.713
the fuck is going on in the US?

27:16.693 --> 27:18.753
You weren't embarrassed about that shit,

27:18.733 --> 27:20.793
but you're embarrassed about this man

27:20.773 --> 27:23.313
and this other man who have finally said,

27:23.293 --> 27:26.993
no, you're not gonna fucking do this shit here.

27:26.973 --> 27:30.233
Okay, I actually thought, in my opinion,

27:30.213 --> 27:34.033
that was the coolest, baddest ass, gangster ass shit

27:34.013 --> 27:35.713
that I've ever seen from either one of those guys.

27:35.693 --> 27:36.554
For sure, bro.

27:36.533 --> 27:40.033
So if you don't like it and that's embarrassing to you,

27:40.013 --> 27:42.013
then maybe you should fucking move.

27:42.168 --> 27:45.308
Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.

27:45.488 --> 27:48.548
And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls.

27:48.528 --> 27:49.948
OK, I call it how I see it.

27:49.928 --> 27:51.268
If he does good, he does good.

27:51.248 --> 27:52.748
If he does bad, he does bad.

27:52.728 --> 27:53.542
That's great.

27:54.030 --> 27:54.579
That's not good.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.108
That's great.

27:55.128 --> 27:55.605
That's great.

27:55.812 --> 27:56.269
OK.

27:56.248 --> 27:58.348
This motherfucker stealing your money.

27:58.328 --> 28:01.468
You guys are out here working and that's the problem.

28:01.448 --> 28:03.908
A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.

28:03.888 --> 28:04.438
They're not working.

28:04.460 --> 28:04.629
Right.

28:04.608 --> 28:08.308
So they don't get, they don't see that tax be taken out of their check

28:08.528 --> 28:11.348
and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.

28:12.020 --> 28:16.680
Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugatti's.

28:17.660 --> 28:18.457
He's got two bucks.

28:18.621 --> 28:18.887
Yeah.

28:19.214 --> 28:19.480
Damn.

28:20.140 --> 28:21.560
Are they cool though?

28:21.540 --> 28:23.320
I mean, you see a bad Bugatti.

28:23.300 --> 28:23.860
Yeah, that's true.

28:24.006 --> 28:24.400
That's fair.

28:24.625 --> 28:27.326
I'm just saying, dude, like that's not, that's not okay.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.926
No, it's cool for me to have to.

28:28.905 --> 28:30.726
You know what I'm saying?

28:30.705 --> 28:32.726
But I didn't, you know,

28:32.705 --> 28:34.606
I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.

28:34.585 --> 28:35.446
Exactly, exactly.

28:35.425 --> 28:37.006
You know, like dude, fuck this guy.

28:36.985 --> 28:37.846
Yeah.

28:37.825 --> 28:39.326
No, I mean, well, so this is what started

28:39.305 --> 28:40.726
that whole chain of events, right?

28:40.705 --> 28:42.126
So you got, I hate this motherfucker.

28:42.105 --> 28:42.966
Oh, bro, I can't stand it.

28:42.945 --> 28:44.846
And I can't stand people standing up for him.

28:44.825 --> 28:47.366
It's so, it's stupid shit.

28:47.710 --> 28:57.090
But after he left the oval office, he decided to go back to Europe and he did a little tour.

28:57.070 --> 29:01.091
Did you hear what he said today about the, about our troops?

29:01.070 --> 29:01.891
You got that clip?

29:01.870 --> 29:03.091
I can put it in.

29:03.070 --> 29:05.331
Bro, this guy gets on television today.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.731
You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.

29:08.669 --> 29:10.729
This guy gets on TV today.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.090
Today is Monday.

29:12.069 --> 29:14.090
Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.

29:14.069 --> 29:15.930
And he fucking says,

29:15.909 --> 29:19.129
the United States is gonna have to send his sons and daughters

29:20.109 --> 29:22.569
to fight in Ukraine and they will die.

29:22.549 --> 29:25.449
That's what he said is almost verbatim exact quote.

29:26.709 --> 29:29.769
Dude, if we send a single soldier over there,

29:29.749 --> 29:32.129
like a single fucking soldier,

29:32.109 --> 29:34.209
this administration is no different than any other one.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.050
100%.

29:35.029 --> 29:35.544
Yeah.

29:35.626 --> 29:36.450
Yeah, 100%, man.

29:36.867 --> 29:40.687
But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour

29:40.667 --> 29:42.688
So he stopped to stop in the UK

29:43.107 --> 29:44.742
He went to the UK first.

29:45.105 --> 29:47.687
He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food they got over there

29:49.107 --> 29:51.328
Gordon Ramsay's the only one else I make food over there

29:53.707 --> 29:59.527
That's why he's so fucking famous bro, that's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's only one over there
