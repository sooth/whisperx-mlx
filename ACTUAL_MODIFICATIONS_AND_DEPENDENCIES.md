# Actual Modifications and Dependencies for mlx_whisper_optimized_final.py

This document lists ALL actual modifications made to achieve the optimized implementation.

## Direct Library Modifications

### 1. **MLX Whisper Library Modifications**

Based on the conversation history, we discovered that the MLX Whisper decoder ALREADY returns cross-attention weights as a third output:
```python
# In mlx_whisper's decoder forward method:
return logits, kv_cache, cross_qk  # cross_qk was already there!
```

However, we didn't actually need to modify the MLX Whisper library files directly because:
- The decoder already returns cross-attention weights
- We use monkey patching at runtime for the broadcasting fix
- We created wrapper classes to intercept the cross-attention weights

### 2. **Runtime Patches Applied**

#### Broadcasting Fix (via monkey patch in mlx_ultra_optimized_batch.py)
```python
def install_broadcasting_fix():
    """Patches mlx_whisper.decoding.ApplyTimestampRules at runtime"""
    # Original method had broadcasting issues in batch mode
    # Fix adds keepdims=True to logsumexp operations
```

This patches `mlx_whisper.decoding.ApplyTimestampRules.apply` to fix:
```python
# Before:
logprobs = logits - mx.logsumexp(logits, axis=-1)  # Shape mismatch!

# After (patched):
logprobs = logits - mx.logsumexp(logits, axis=-1, keepdims=True)  # Works!
```

## Custom Files Created

### 1. **mlx_whisper_batch_decoder.py**
- Complete custom implementation of batch processing
- `BatchInference` class that manages KV cache for multiple sequences
- `BatchDecodingTask` for orchestrating batch decoding
- Key insight: The original `BatchInference.logits()` method was discarding cross-attention weights:
  ```python
  logits, new_kv_cache, _ = self.model.decoder(...)  # _ discards cross_qk!
  ```

### 2. **mlx_whisper_optimized_final.py** 
- Contains `CrossAttentionBatchInference` that extends `BatchInference`
- Intercepts and stores cross-attention weights during decoding:
  ```python
  outputs = self.model.decoder(active_tokens, active_audio)
  if len(outputs) >= 3 and outputs[2] is not None:
      self._store_cross_attention(outputs[2], active_indices)
  ```

### 3. **median_filter_fix.py**
- Fixes scipy's median filter to handle 2D arrays properly
- Required for DTW alignment processing

### 4. **mlx_ultra_optimized_batch.py**
- Contains the `install_broadcasting_fix()` function
- Also has an earlier implementation attempt

## Key Discoveries from Development

1. **MLX Whisper's decoder already returns cross-attention weights** - We just needed to capture them instead of discarding them with `_`

2. **Broadcasting bug in batch mode** - MLX Whisper's timestamp rules had shape mismatches that prevented batch processing with timestamps

3. **No actual MLX Whisper source files were permanently modified** - Everything works via:
   - Runtime monkey patching for the broadcasting fix
   - Custom wrapper classes that intercept outputs
   - Temporary replacement of BatchInference class

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- `mlx` - Apple's MLX framework
- `mlx-whisper` - MLX Whisper (unmodified, but patched at runtime)
- `numpy`, `scipy` - Numerical computing
- `librosa` - Audio loading
- Standard library: `json`, `time`, `argparse`, `dataclasses`, `typing`, `warnings`

### Model
- `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-mlx` (or other MLX Whisper models)

## Installation
```bash
pip install mlx mlx-whisper numpy scipy librosa
```

## How It Works

1. **On startup**: `install_broadcasting_fix()` patches MLX Whisper's decoding
2. **During processing**: 
   - Original `BatchInference` is temporarily replaced with `CrossAttentionBatchInference`
   - Cross-attention weights are collected in global `_cross_attention_data`
   - After batch decoding, weights are used for DTW alignment
3. **Result**: True single-stage processing with accurate word timestamps at ~28x realtime

## Summary

The key insight was that MLX Whisper already had everything we needed - we just had to:
1. Fix the broadcasting bug (via monkey patch)
2. Stop discarding the cross-attention weights (via wrapper class)
3. Implement proper batch processing with KV cache management
4. Use DTW alignment on the collected attention weights

No permanent modifications to MLX framework or MLX Whisper library files were needed!
