3338	6138	Sleepin' on the floor, now my jewelry box froze.
6278	9438	Fuck a bowl, fuck a stove, counted millions in a cold.
9598	12758	Bad bitch, booted swole, got her own bankroll.
12918	16118	Can't fold, just a note, headshot, case closed.
16638	20058	What is up guys, it's Andy Frisella and this is the show for the real.
20118	23298	Let's say goodbye to the lies, the fakeness, and delusions of modern society.
23418	24678	Welcome to motherfuckin' reality.
24818	28878	Guys, today we have Andy and DJ!
29528	31228	Cruz the motherfucking internet.
31368	32088	That's what we're going to do.
32168	33448	That's what CTI stands for.
33528	34868	It stands for Cruz the internet.
36048	37828	I didn't know if you guys could figure that out.
38448	40688	But what we do here is we put topics on the screen.
40828	43008	We speculate on what's true and what's not true.
43608	48648	And then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems that all these knuckleheads create.
49828	51168	Let's just get right into it.
51808	53308	We don't run ads on the show.
55229	57029	So we ask that you don't be a hoe.
58129	59209	And you share the show.
59309	59689	There you go.
60069	60309	Yep.
60809	61969	You're looking good, man.
62149	62429	Is it?
62549	62909	Damn.
63229	63429	Yeah.
63829	66709	I saw you trying to start work out, and I know what the fuck you're up to.
66889	67529	What am I up to?
67729	69789	Trying to fucking catch up and beat me.
70289	71149	I can't let you.
72880	73520	I can't let you.
73860	75120	I can't.
75240	76360	Bro, you look good, man.
76420	76620	Shit.
77020	77520	You're looking good.
77560	79140	I don't know if it might just be the sweater.
79320	80560	I don't think it's the sweater, though.
80580	81280	No, it's my face.
81360	81840	Fuck, man.
82020	82620	Like, hey.
83000	83200	Yeah.
83340	83820	What's up?
84160	84780	You tell me.
84800	85700	You look good, too, bro.
85860	86340	Thanks, man.
86340	86860	Pull me down.
87020	87300	Yeah.
88540	90240	We had a big event this weekend.
90840	92380	Dude, that was a big historic event.
92620	92900	Right.
92900	92960	Yeah.
92960	93960	Yeah.
95898	98558	Big Jim turns 80 years old yesterday.
99278	99578	Shit.
99658	100738	We went to dinner on Saturday.
100858	101498	It was a good time.
101678	102078	It was good.
102218	102998	It was a good time, man.
102998	103718	It's always nice.
103938	104538	It's always nice.
104638	106538	He was kind of surprised.
107678	108958	You know, he's been around, man.
108978	110918	It's hard to get him.
111423	112903	I mean, he's been around that many blocks.
113103	113303	Yeah.
113463	116123	I mean, he fought in the Civil War.
118863	120443	He's seen it, thank you, too.
120563	121083	That's for sure.
121343	121503	Yeah.
121963	122823	80 years.
122923	123463	Fuck, man.
123603	124443	That's a long time.
124523	125463	Yeah, still moving, though.
125463	126963	We ought to get him on the show, maybe.
127723	128703	I mean, if you got-
128703	129563	Do an interview of his 80 years.
129643	133303	Yeah, if you guys are ready for a six-hour podcast, let us know.
133803	134523	That's the truth.
135443	136803	It's going to be an all-day affair.
138406	139026	What else going on?
139026	140046	It'll be fucking good, though, man.
140066	140266	Yeah.
140266	141606	Yeah, everything is good, man.
141966	143106	You know, everything is good.
143206	144586	We got a lot to talk about.
145046	145506	I bet.
145686	146006	Yeah.
146426	146966	I bet.
147346	148486	Let's do some cruising.
148726	149146	Let's do it.
149146	153786	Before we get to our headlines, you know, I always try to throw a little special sauce
153786	154366	in there for you.
155646	156866	We just landed on the moon.
158366	158926	Who did?
159306	159746	We did.
160426	161006	Me and you?
161166	161986	No, like America.
162246	162526	Oh.
162826	163066	Yep.
163246	163806	Lunar Lander.
164832	170072	Firefly blue glow blue ghost lunar lander touches down on the moon. This is first time
171332	173332	ever
175152	179552	How about say, you know, I was gonna say, you know, I would believe this when chicks can grow
179552	182512	You can't look back at them at the fucking old footage
182592	188132	You cannot look back at the old footage and be like, yeah and be like, oh, yeah, that's totally real like
189892	190632	You just can't.
191232	197152	If you do, I got some ocean property in Arizona, bro.
197212	197612	Bro.
197772	204772	Like, you just can't tell me that's real.
204832	205172	I'm sorry.
205172	207892	Listen, I believe this when chicks can have dicks.
208132	208772	You know what I'm saying?
209032	210632	Well, apparently they can.
210712	212192	Well, one's more truer than the other, though.
214272	215852	Did you see that study I sent you?
216301	217621	Oh, yeah, dude, that's sad.
217641	225601	Bro, I sent DJ a study today, and they said that they ran some studies on people who actually transition.
225601	236081	So one of the big arguments in gender transition is that before they transition, they have a likelihood suicide rate of, I think, like 48%.
236081	238341	Right, and so doing the surgery saves their lives.
238361	240821	Yes, that's the justification for these people.
241021	243241	But now there's been a study that's come out.
243638	247638	A recent study published in Oxford's.
247638	248698	Yeah, well, you know Oxford.
248938	249798	They don't know what they're doing.
249858	250858	They trust science there.
251858	265258	Oxford's Journal of Sexual Medicine sampling 107,000 people found that sex change surgery doubles depression rates among gender dysphoric individuals rather than reducing.
265378	267278	So it goes from 48 to 96.
268298	269718	I ain't going mad.
271878	273118	Who's counting, man?
273118	273418	Yeah.
273625	276565	I would have never guessed.
276745	280805	I would have never guessed that if you cut off your penis,
280925	282385	that eventually you're going to regret it.
282385	283125	You're going to have some problems.
283285	286385	I would never have guessed if you cut off your breasts,
286445	288025	eventually you're going to regret it.
288125	292985	I would have never guessed if you sewed your vagina shut
292985	297545	and put a piece of skin from your leg as a penis,
297685	298785	that I would regret that.
298925	300585	I mean, who would have known?
301265	302205	Who would have known?
303342	303982	I mean, I'm shocked.
304102	306442	Bro, I would be fucked up if I cut my penis off.
307202	308262	First of all, it's a lot of cutting.
308782	310242	All right, but second of all.
310442	312302	Not according to Alex at dinner the other night.
312322	312642	Bullshit.
312762	313302	No, bullshit.
313342	313762	Yeah, bro.
314082	314122	Bullshit.
314342	314622	Yeah.
314822	315282	What do you mean?
315382	316142	What did I miss?
316282	317602	Wait, what did she say?
318242	318822	What'd she say?
318942	319322	I don't know.
319422	320062	She said something.
320202	320902	I can't say it.
320962	322122	I'll call her ass right now.
322242	322442	Yeah.
322664	333464	um no i mean but it makes sense bro you can't just do that man like and here's the thing
333464	339064	it's common sense bro it is but here's the thing this is a relatively new thing in our society and
339064	344104	the problem is is that they were able to spout all of these justifications there wasn't enough
344104	348184	time for these type of studies to even come through you got to follow that out you
348184	351224	know what i'm saying it takes some time to get a good base of evidence there
351790	353570	And, yeah, so, I mean, it makes sense.
353670	356810	But, yeah, so, I mean, Chicks with Dicks is more possible than going to the moon, though.
356870	357130	Yeah.
357410	357650	Yeah.
358710	362650	The funniest thing about this, though, real quick, so, you know, Buzz Aldrin?
363210	363450	Yeah.
363450	364290	I didn't know he was still alive.
364390	364890	He's still alive.
364910	365150	Is he?
365770	370470	And they got to show him what it actually looks like to land on the moon for the first time.
372250	375070	It reports lunar gravity, and it is stable.
377050	377530	Come on.
377590	378310	That's fake, too.
380174	381254	Alcon, she mentioned here.
381374	382314	Looks better than any of you.
382874	383534	Y'all suck land.
383754	384114	We're out of here.
385694	386094	Okay.
393094	395134	He's like, shit, so that's what it really looks like.
396794	398134	Here's a picture they supplied.
398274	399174	This is supposed to be.
399254	399894	Who took the picture?
403054	403494	I don't know.
404354	404574	Yeah.
406246	410806	Anyway, we all know the government's liars, and we all know NASA's liars,
410846	415346	and we all know it's a massive money laundering scheme, just like all the other shit.
415826	418986	How many billions of dollars are pumped through NASA
418986	423926	and then filtered back through different SPFs and perks and donations and funding?
424201	428801	Yeah, I mean, I was wondering, I wonder if they do, like, any real, like, you know, crazy shit.
428901	431801	Like, you know, like, if they fuck with, like, any aliens or something.
431921	432321	You know what I'm saying?
432361	433401	Like, that maybe is the front.
433541	434681	Like, it's a front for something.
435281	436441	I'm a firm believer that.
436441	437901	I just said what it was a front for.
437961	439661	It's a front for these people to get rich, bro.
439961	446841	Yeah, but, like, I think originally, like, the whole reason we even did that was to, like, fucking, you know, funnel the money to cover up the fucking Cold War and shit.
446841	447241	You know?
447321	447501	I don't know.
447877	449357	Beat the Russians, you know.
449737	452297	Well, that was the original motivation.
453077	454237	But nobody went.
454717	455097	That's right.
455177	456197	Nobody fucking went, bro.
456317	460397	They faked it so that they could demoralize the Russians during the Cold War.
460397	462377	I mean, that's what that was about.
462377	463397	That was the basis of it, yeah.
463577	464637	Race to the moon.
464837	465137	Yep.
465757	466317	We'll beat you.
468177	470077	Out here in Arizona, you might as well stop.
472227	472687	Yeah, man.
472747	473807	It is what it is, man.
473867	476227	But guys, hope you're ready for a show.
476827	481747	Remember, if you wanted to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to andyfussella.com.
481767	482947	You want to make people real mad?
483187	483407	What?
483607	485387	You tell them that the earth isn't flat.
485767	486427	Oh, fuck.
486527	487287	Now, hold on.
487287	487807	Now, you listen.
488147	490287	The flat earthers are fucking passionate about it.
490287	490767	No, listen.
490947	492567	I mean, there's an argument.
492927	493547	No, there's not.
493667	494667	There's an argument, bro.
495227	496047	We've been up in planes.
496107	496767	What does it look like?
501674	502874	You've seen what I've seen.
504694	505814	I'm just saying, bro.
506074	506714	40,000 feet up.
506714	507994	You motherfuckers think the Earth's flat?
509034	509674	Joe does.
510034	511114	Joe Young does.
511194	512274	I know Joe Young does.
512334	512634	Yeah, bro.
512674	513454	We're ice shelfers.
514474	516094	I think ice shelf could be true.
516214	516374	No.
517154	518994	If that's true, then the Earth's flat.
519254	519774	I think...
519774	520894	No.
521474	521894	Yeah.
522094	522514	No.
522914	525194	Ice shelf theory is not about flat Earth.
526278	526718	It's about-
526718	527558	No, I'm not saying it is.
527618	530018	I'm saying if that is true, though, then it would have to be true.
530018	532098	No, there's still going to be some curvature.
532558	533338	It's like a fishbowl.
533518	537118	No, it's like the top crown of somebody with a bald head.
538298	538878	Like you.
539278	540858	If you just drew a little circle on your hat.
540918	543918	You wore one of them little hats, you know, those little tiny ones on your head.
544138	546398	The pointy ones or the-
546398	547298	No, the little ones.
547938	549738	You know, those little round hats.
553717	554537	A condom, Andy?
554597	555257	What are you talking about?
555477	558097	Like, what kind of hat on my head?
559137	559797	You know.
559877	560217	All right.
561577	561977	Anyway.
562177	562697	Yeah, man.
562757	563397	Hey, listen.
563817	564757	Go to Andy.com.
564997	565137	Yeah.
565217	566517	Go to AndyFacella.com.
567200	568780	I wonder where it takes you to andy.com.
569240	570140	Is that a real thing?
571140	572580	Let's get into our headlines, man.
572620	574060	We got some interesting stuff.
574160	577140	Let's start with first series of headlines.
577260	578000	Headline number one.
578480	579660	I wanted to get into this,
579800	582560	and this may be some foreshadowing going on.
582620	584360	I don't know, but I saw it,
584380	587220	and I immediately felt that this is not good.
587635	592195	So J.D. Vance went to a ski trip or tried to go to a ski trip.
593255	600335	And this was supposed to be like, you know, like usually they don't announce the vacation shit until like, you know, he's already there or they're gone.
600435	600675	Right.
600715	602275	Like that's a typical security thing.
602275	602595	Right.
603135	605795	I mean, hell, we don't really post where we are when we're there.
605795	608015	We post it after on the fucking plane ride home.
608115	608595	You know what I'm saying?
608695	609815	Like that's a typical thing.
609855	610075	Right.
610675	616095	And so J.D. Vance was supposed to be taking his family to this ski resort in Vermont.
616762	621142	And before he even got there, I don't know if you guys saw this.
621282	627802	There was some people counted 500 fucking protesters that were already there.
628962	629262	All right.
629342	631442	Now, I mean, DJ, what's the big deal here?
631842	635482	Well, if you got I mean, first of all, people don't understand.
636387	645427	The level of logistics that has to go into organizing even a couple of hundred people together at the same time to get them into a specific location ahead of time.
646027	649747	This spells there is a fucking leak on his detail that needs to be removed.
650798	651878	There's no way.
652558	655598	That's not, like, how would they know that information ahead of time?
655918	658058	To even organize 500 fucking people to get there.
658058	661838	Yeah, there's somebody in logistics leaking information.
661838	662858	Leaking that shit out, bro.
663298	665478	And like I said, it wasn't a couple, bro.
665518	666638	It was a shit ton of them.
666838	666998	Yeah.
667418	668218	Vance is a traitor.
668338	669198	Go ski in Russia.
670278	673158	Vance equals Putin's pawn equals traitor.
673618	674678	So, dude, these people.
675790	682990	think that Putin is the problem. All the while, people are being arrested for making social media
682990	688850	posts all through Europe. Okay. We have migrant gangs attacking women and raping women and
688850	691770	stabbing people and killing them who aren't European.
692834	693094	Okay?
693274	697154	We have people being arrested for praying in their homes already.
697894	698154	Okay?
698254	703194	And these people are terrified of Vladimir Putin when all of this shit is already happening?
703314	704054	Going on around them.
704274	704574	Yeah, right.
704614	706834	Like, what are you guys fighting for?
708014	708374	You know?
710374	714434	These people have been drinking this Kool-Aid their whole lives from the media,
714434	719114	and they can't figure out that they've been lied to about fucking everything.
719885	729045	All right. And dude, did you see that? That comment I got from I told I did I show you that comment I got from one of the people who follows me about the Ukraine shit.
729045	740685	Yeah. He's like Ukraine's a sovereign nation. And, you know, we as the most powerful country in the world have a responsibility to stick up for countries that can't defend themselves.
740785	743045	Well, let me stop you right there, homie. No, we don't.
743763	747163	We don't have a responsibility to stand up for anybody but Americans.
747383	752783	And the truth of the matter is, is America first means America first.
752783	757823	It means zero dollars to them until we are good and we are not good.
758443	763923	OK, on top of that, we are now getting drug into.
765650	768670	An actual war because of our involvement with NATO.
768930	770630	They're sending troops in.
770970	782490	They would rather blow up the entire world than to have the truth about the entire fucking system that oppresses citizens globally to come out and how they do it.
782570	782950	Yeah, right.
783470	783690	Right.
783690	786850	But they're supposed to be the people of peace and love and tolerance.
787190	788430	And here we are.
788470	789130	It's insane, dude.
789430	790290	World War III on the doorstep.
790370	790550	Yeah.
790750	791570	For what reason?
791810	792450	For what reason?
793410	794010	What reason?
794962	799262	The only reason that these people all want this war, I'm not talking about these morons.
799542	803342	I'm talking about the people who are actually making the decisions.
803342	804182	Who write the shit on paper.
804282	807642	Yes, who are sending other people's children to die.
808162	815742	The only reason they want to do that is because they don't want the truth to come out about how all these nations collaborate to oppress the citizens of humanity.
816002	816142	Yep.
816882	818002	Yep, 100%, man.
818062	821042	Like I said, I saw this, and I'm just foreshadowing, bro.
821062	822222	This is some dangerous shit.
823802	826142	And they definitely need to lock that shit in.
826282	826702	You know what I'm saying?
826742	831882	Because we've seen what happens when you have leaks in your security team twice now with Donald Trump.
832362	832962	I mean, fuck.
833142	838482	J.D. Vance obviously being an incumbent potential running candidate for 2028.
838482	841262	I mean, bro, like, I mean, it'd be a good way to get him out beforehand.
841542	842882	They got somebody fucking in this team.
843002	843602	I'm telling you right now.
843602	844462	A hundred percent, dude.
844462	845382	There's no doubt.
845570	846470	They need to watch it.
846570	850610	Listen, this administration is still full with rats.
851250	855170	It's still full of people who aren't on the side of the citizens.
855430	857950	You know, it's still full of this.
858050	858190	Yeah.
858479	863719	Yeah. Well, so what kicked off all of this Putin nonsense?
863719	871119	We got to go back a couple of days to this meeting that happened with Trump, Vance, and Zelensky of Ukraine.
872459	878499	Now, I will say this, because we got plenty of criticism to give out here today on Trump and the Trump administration.
878639	879839	Look what these people call him, dude.
880019	883279	Protester held sign labeling Vance a traitor and Nazi scum.
883459	883619	Yeah.
883799	886159	You motherfuckers don't even know anything about Nazi.
886559	887379	You don't know it.
887559	894899	And you keep calling people Nazis, which is just emboldening people to come out with polarizing viewpoints.
894939	896279	It's the same thing they did with racism.
896279	897059	Yeah, dude.
897159	897559	Exactly.
897699	899319	And now people are like, well, you know what?
900683	901903	Black people do steal shit.
901943	902223	Yeah.
902543	903403	I mean, it's like, no.
904023	905463	Bro, that, no.
905603	906443	You know what?
906723	906923	No.
907023	913363	It's almost good that they do this because they devalue their defense mechanism.
913563	915243	Well, their offense mechanism, right?
915403	915523	Right.
915623	917063	Shut the fuck up or you're a Nazi.
917263	917403	Right.
917443	918903	Shut the fuck up or you're a racist.
919363	920603	And that shit ain't working anymore.
920663	921283	No one cares.
921283	921483	No.
921723	924283	And it just exposed how radical they are.
924463	924723	Yes.
924803	927023	And what the truth that they actually are trying to push behind.
927143	927563	Well, unfortunately.
927565	933425	also it brings a it brings to the surface the element that they claim to want to suppress
933425	940605	um you know when you call everybody racist for 20 fucking years eventually they're like yeah you
940605	945445	know what i am because i'm tired of getting called this and this and this from you fuckers fuck you
945445	951945	simply right yeah like dude and what happens is you you end up radical they end up radicalizing
951945	952425	people.
953570	955530	It works the opposite of what they want.
955650	959570	They end up radicalizing people that would otherwise just be normal.
959730	960170	Normal people.
960170	962270	You know, and dude, that's a fucking bad thing.
962350	963890	That's not good for society.
964370	972550	Like, I don't buy into this shit here in the United States of America that, you know, and I don't buy into it in humanity either.
972550	972870	Like.
973516	977056	I don't care if someone's Japanese or Chinese or this or that or this.
977336	980876	And maybe I'm ignorant and maybe I'm naive by not caring about that.
981136	985996	Because it seems like every other fucking race of people gives a lot of fucks about their own race.
986496	990336	And, you know, being a white guy that was raised in the United States of America,
990336	993676	I've been told that I was a fucking problem pretty much my whole fucking life.
993796	996436	So I never made my race my identity.
996576	999476	I never said, yeah, I'm fucking proud to be white.
999556	1000876	That was never a thing.
1001613	1008153	I was always looking at everybody else just like MLK says, dude, the content of their character, who they are, you know.
1008353	1010193	And I think most people are like that.
1010193	1012473	And I think we're getting to a point where.
1013223	1015483	You know, everybody's coming back to that,
1015543	1017643	and these people who are calling all the names
1017643	1018803	are going to be ostracized.
1018903	1020143	Like, nobody's listening to this shit.
1020583	1021663	We're fucking Nazi.
1022303	1023983	Bro, you don't even know what,
1024103	1026323	you don't even know anything about the history
1026323	1027643	of fucking Nazi movement.
1028103	1030563	You don't know anything of the history of World War I
1030563	1033483	or World War II or how the Federal Reserve was formed.
1033483	1036243	You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
1036443	1036923	Period.
1038367	1038947	That's just it.
1038967	1039447	No, it's stupid.
1039447	1040147	They don't know.
1040507	1043327	And they use these fucking terms, dude.
1043387	1044367	And I'm going to tell you what, man.
1047307	1049107	I get called every name in the book now.
1049187	1049667	I don't care.
1050027	1050607	Yeah, I take it.
1050727	1051867	I mean, I like smile.
1052087	1053627	I wear them as badges of honor.
1053707	1056587	Yeah, well, dude, why do you think Kanye's got a fucking swastika t-shirt?
1056767	1058407	Because he's basically saying, well, fuck you.
1059173	1064293	And you guys can get mad about that all you want, but he's forcing you to pay attention.
1064933	1071593	And then when you look at the symbol and the history of a swastika, you start to realize that it's been used for 12,000 years.
1071793	1076753	And it's actually meant to be good luck and good fortune and prosperity through human history.
1076913	1079313	And it wasn't until Adolf Hitler used that.
1079613	1081513	Now, by the way, why do you think he used that?
1081921	1084541	Do you think he used that to represent evil?
1084901	1087781	In his mind, that's what he was fighting for.
1087781	1093181	Yeah, he was, in his mind, he was fighting for what that symbol actually meant.
1093281	1098141	And then since then, that symbol has been, you know, you can't fucking use it or you're a Nazi.
1098461	1101061	Well, bro, if you go to Eastern cultures, it's everywhere.
1101241	1101981	It's on the buildings.
1102121	1105341	It's, I mean, it's still, is that not true, Syed?
1105461	1105801	Yeah, sorry.
1106001	1106221	Yeah.
1106501	1107781	So, like.
1108870	1114190	You know, people like my point in all of this saying this is like these motherfuckers don't even know that.
1114370	1114530	No.
1115570	1117670	And it's like, and dude, let's pay attention.
1117790	1119890	Who are, let's, who are these people?
1120910	1121650	Who are they?
1121930	1123110	What race are they?
1123850	1124470	Oh, they're all white.
1124510	1125250	Oh, they're all white.
1125330	1127090	And what gender are they?
1127510	1128190	All women.
1128490	1129670	And what age are they?
1130318	1132958	I mean, they're bruncher age for sure.
1133078	1134278	And what are they wearing?
1134738	1139158	Oh, they're wearing North Face and they're wearing fucking $400 jackets.
1139778	1140058	Right, right.
1140798	1145378	Well, I guarantee you a lot of them probably just got laid off from USAID.
1145578	1146418	Yeah, for sure.
1146418	1149258	Listen, this group of people.
1149877	1155717	is legitimately the worst group of people when they start to talk about society's issues because
1155717	1160917	they are so privileged they don't have any worries they live in upper middle class
1160917	1166757	areas and they drink champagne on sundays and then they want to seem virtuous by caring and
1166757	1171237	because they don't have any other meaning in their life and and by the way if you want to
1171237	1176037	seem virtuous and care stand up for the right thing the thing you go go actually go to
1176037	1177857	to Ukraine. Go fight in fucking Ukraine.
1178057	1178977	I don't want to hear it, dude.
1179408	1180408	I don't give a fuck.
1180608	1181068	You know what?
1181128	1182168	I'm America first.
1182648	1182988	Period.
1183308	1187008	I don't give a fuck if it's Ukraine, if it's Israel, or anybody else.
1187448	1189168	Here first, then there.
1189168	1195288	And we have a lot of fucking work to do here before we should ever even consider giving a fucking dollar to anybody else.
1195508	1196488	Doesn't matter who it is.
1197028	1202028	And, by the way, if a country can't defend itself, well then maybe they should fucking work on that.
1204332	1205472	Makes sense to me, man.
1205552	1207272	But guys, let's slow this down.
1207532	1211152	Let's talk about how we even got to having these protests.
1211252	1213172	You know why the United States funds all these countries?
1214152	1214832	Do you know why?
1214912	1215532	Because we have to.
1215712	1215932	No.
1216492	1217012	That's not why.
1218406	1221026	The United States adopted a strategy a long time ago.
1221886	1225706	They golden handcuffed these countries, okay?
1225946	1228006	So they either say, hey, we'll give you this aid,
1228046	1230106	but you can't make this and this and this and this and this
1230106	1231786	as part of the agreement, right?
1231846	1233646	Can't make these weapons, can't do this thing.
1234126	1238046	Or they give them the money knowing that...
1237998	1242218	The United States has their back and sort of handicaps them from any innovation.
1242598	1243138	Any prosperity.
1243598	1246258	Any innovation because they're getting their money from an outside source.
1246358	1247718	It's no different than a rich kid.
1248178	1248398	Okay?
1248438	1252538	You got a little rich kid whose dad and mom keep giving him money, keep giving him money,
1252638	1254598	keep giving him money, keep giving him money, keep giving him money.
1254598	1258238	Do you think that kid's going to ever learn how to operate in reality?
1258438	1258558	No.
1258958	1261058	Now, take that concept and apply it to a country.
1261658	1261798	Okay?
1261878	1265598	If you keep foreign aiding a country, what I'm saying here is that...
1266500	1269020	We do this to handicap the other countries intentionally.
1269200	1269380	Yeah.
1269480	1270560	And it needs to fucking stop.
1270760	1271120	Yeah, bro.
1271140	1272160	Take them off the teat, bro.
1272180	1273540	Make them learn how to get the food themselves.
1274760	1276260	Get strong or get conquered.
1276440	1277740	I don't give a fuck.
1277960	1278700	I don't care.
1278940	1280020	I'm American, bro.
1280180	1281420	I care about us first.
1281620	1283180	Do I care about people in Europe?
1283320	1284380	Yeah, I got friends in Europe.
1284520	1285860	Do I care about people in Australia?
1286080	1286600	Yeah, I do.
1286940	1289540	Do I care about them more than us?
1289680	1290640	No, sorry, I don't.
1290700	1291340	I care about us.
1292099	1293359	Yeah, 100%, bro.
1294619	1295979	But yeah, let's slow this down.
1296039	1302259	Let's see where this all started, because we've got to go back a couple of days to a meeting that Trump, Vance, and Zelensky had at the White House.
1303059	1308299	And this was the first time we got to really see any type of negotiations, I guess, with the press corps being there.
1308535	1311135	which I believe was part of Trump's play.
1311355	1318695	I mean, obviously, because apparently word on the street is that this is exactly how Zelensky was behind cameras.
1319035	1323435	And then Trump made the cameras available and everybody got to see his true colors.
1323535	1324615	So let's check this clip out.
1325360	1328940	I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.
1329100	1330460	Yes, but if you are not strong...
1330460	1334020	Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office
1334020	1336020	and try to litigate this in front of the American media.
1336360	1340620	Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines
1340620	1342360	because you have manpower problems.
1342680	1346120	You should be thanking the President to bring an end to this conflict.
1346120	1348860	Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?
1349103	1350363	I have been to...
1350363	1351063	Count once.
1351083	1354643	I've actually watched and seen the stories,
1354903	1356963	and I know what happens is you bring people,
1357283	1359623	you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.
1360123	1364123	Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military?
1364163	1364683	We have problems.
1364683	1369163	And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America
1369163	1373443	and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?
1373463	1374763	A lot of questions.
1375043	1376103	Let's start from the beginning.
1376163	1376343	Sure.
1376423	1378103	First of all, during the war,
1378634	1385974	Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future
1386374	1389454	God bless you don't know that God bless you. God bless you
1390394	1394214	Don't tell us what we're gonna feel brother was a threat. Hold on stop it
1395254	1399674	That was a fucking hundred percent. That was a fucking threat a hundred percent
1400588	1402008	Fuck this little motherfucker.
1402668	1406488	Throw him in the fucking wood chipper right there, and the war ends.
1407048	1408788	Nobody in Ukraine wants this war.
1409408	1414548	This motherfucker wants the war because him and his fucking homies are stealing all the money.
1414668	1415148	You get paid.
1415759	1416239	Get paid, bro.
1416239	1417199	That was a fucking...
1417199	1418639	Bro, you're sitting in the Oval Office.
1418639	1421499	What I love about this, though, is I love how Trump is...
1421499	1421899	Immediately?
1422159	1422359	No.
1422499	1423579	I love how Trump's sitting.
1423639	1424439	He's letting him talk.
1424499	1424699	Yeah.
1424859	1425439	Let's him talk.
1425519	1426019	Let's him talk.
1426079	1426539	Let's him talk.
1426619	1427119	Let's him talk.
1427679	1431679	The guy gets one inch out of line, and he said, hold on.
1432299	1433359	And then let's play the rest.
1433359	1434419	It fucking hammers him, bro.
1434499	1435779	Tell us what we're going to feel.
1435839	1436739	I'm not telling you.
1436739	1438739	Because you're in no position to dictate that.
1438879	1439499	Remember this.
1439639	1439979	I'm not telling you.
1439979	1443919	You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel.
1444463	1461983	We're going to feel very good. We're going to feel very good and very strong. You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about it. You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now.
1462300	1463700	With us, you start having cards.
1463700	1464300	I'm not playing cards.
1464300	1466040	Right now, you're playing cards.
1466040	1466700	I'm very serious, Mr. President.
1466720	1467180	You're playing cards.
1467180	1467820	I'm very serious.
1467820	1470460	You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.
1470640	1472880	You're gambling with World War III.
1473220	1475780	You're gambling with World War III.
1476420	1481120	And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.
1481420	1482700	It's back to you.
1482700	1483000	I'm with all respect to you.
1483000	1485800	Far more than a lot of people said they should have.
1485820	1487000	Have you said thank you once?
1487275	1488415	A lot of times.
1488555	1489695	Even today.
1491135	1494735	You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.
1495235	1498555	Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America
1498555	1502295	and the president who's trying to save your country.
1503635	1504475	And your life.
1505602	1506862	Look, dude, he's dead anyway.
1507162	1507922	They're going to kill this dude.
1508242	1510402	Listen, either side's going to do it.
1510462	1510962	Yeah, for sure.
1511002	1511622	He's getting killed.
1511762	1512702	This guy's fucking done.
1512862	1515682	They can't let that dude walk knowing what he knows, bro.
1515882	1516762	No, not only that.
1516882	1517542	No, he stole.
1517742	1518942	Dude, he knows where all the money went.
1518962	1520482	He knows exactly where it went.
1520762	1521222	You know what I'm saying?
1521282	1522282	They can't let that dude walk.
1522409	1550629	Yeah. See, you know, we call it how we see it. A lot of people here on the internet, you know, like a lot of people were upset. I saw this like, you know, I'm so embarrassed to be an American. I'm so dis listen, dude, you've never done anything that fucking matters. Okay. Real talk. You've never had to fight for anything. You've never had to negotiate for anything. This is extremely normal conversation in any business environment amongst men. Okay.
1551367	1554087	When people step out of line, you step on their fucking face.
1554287	1555747	And that's what Trump does.
1555927	1559147	He's very respectful until that man gets disrespectful.
1559387	1561067	He just threatened our country, bro.
1561227	1561387	Dude.
1561627	1562827	And we got people in this country.
1562827	1563607	What are we going to feel?
1563767	1564007	Brother.
1564007	1564507	If we don't help?
1564607	1564727	Wait.
1564847	1565087	Brother.
1565307	1570527	First of all, we got people in this country that fucking are on his side.
1571313	1574533	Like, bro, if you're on this dude's side over our side, fuck off.
1575073	1575733	Go over there.
1576033	1576693	Go live in Europe.
1576953	1577733	Go live in Ukraine.
1577853	1578373	They'll take you.
1578913	1583413	And then they'll take you to the front lines like they're taking people with Down syndrome
1583413	1585613	to the front fucking lines.
1585893	1587073	Bro, I saw that clip.
1587233	1589253	All you motherfuckers talking all this shit.
1589333	1590793	You don't know what you're talking about, dude.
1591173	1592133	You have no idea.
1592213	1593413	You haven't been paying attention.
1593833	1595253	You're sucked into your own life.
1595253	1599093	You're watching the Kardashians and all this other fucking fake ass bullshit.
1599815	1602335	And then you spout off about how this is embarrassing.
1602795	1603375	You know what?
1604155	1607995	You weren't embarrassed when our country was run by a literal vegetable.
1607995	1609995	You weren't embarrassed when...
1611475	1615275	They stole all your money and closed your businesses and fucked with you.
1615595	1620515	You weren't embarrassed when our whole country is a laughingstock of the entire world
1620515	1625095	because we're over here with a couple of fucking morons running our country.
1625335	1626555	Trans titties on the front line.
1626555	1629715	Bro, we got trans generals and, you know, we got kids.
1629835	1631875	We're promoting kids cutting off their dick.
1631875	1633595	And everybody else in the world is like.
1634493	1639473	the fuck is going on in the u.s you weren't embarrassed about that shit but you're embarrassed
1639473	1646273	about this man and this other man who have finally said uh no you're not gonna fucking do this shit
1646273	1653693	here okay i actually thought in my opinion that was the coolest baddest ass gangster ass shit
1653693	1658733	that i've ever seen from either one of those guys for sure bro so uh if you don't like it
1658733	1661733	and that's embarrassing to you then maybe you should fucking move
1662168	1665188	Maybe you should move because this is how we do things here.
1665548	1668748	And by the way, I don't jockey on Trump's balls, okay?
1668808	1669928	I call it how I see it.
1669948	1671208	If he does good, he does good.
1671248	1672448	If he does bad, he does bad.
1672808	1673488	That's great.
1673948	1674508	That's not good.
1674568	1675008	That's great.
1675168	1675548	That's great.
1675708	1675948	Okay?
1676308	1678128	This motherfucker's stealing your money.
1678428	1681388	You guys are out here working, and that's the problem.
1681488	1683848	A lot of these people that are on, they're not working.
1683848	1684288	They're not working.
1684288	1684528	Right?
1684668	1688248	So they don't see that tax be taken out of their check.
1688248	1691248	and then think about it going over to this guy so he can buy.
1692020	1696640	Four different mansions and fucking a yacht and two Bugattis.
1697740	1698380	He's got two bugs?
1698560	1698820	Yeah.
1699120	1699420	Damn.
1700220	1700840	Are they cool, though?
1701560	1703220	I mean, have you seen a bad Bugatti?
1703300	1703820	Yeah, that's true.
1703940	1704360	That's fair.
1704625	1706425	I'm just saying, dude, like, that's not.
1706525	1707185	That's not okay.
1707385	1708685	No, it's cool for me to have to.
1709785	1710525	You know what I'm saying?
1710725	1714525	But I didn't, you know, I didn't steal your fucking tax dollars to do it.
1714625	1714945	Exactly.
1715205	1716905	You know, like, dude, fuck this guy.
1717025	1717205	Yeah.
1717425	1720705	No, I mean, well, so this is what started that whole chain of events, right?
1720745	1721065	So you got.
1721065	1722005	I hate this motherfucker.
1722105	1722785	Oh, bro, I can't stand him.
1722785	1724785	And I can't stand people standing up for him.
1724785	1727145	It's so, it's stupid shit.
1727710	1734770	But after he left the Oval Office, he decided to go back to Europe,
1734770	1736910	and he did a little tour.
1736910	1737990	Did you hear what he said today?
1738710	1740670	About our kids?
1740690	1741070	Our troops.
1741270	1741910	You got that clip?
1742090	1742770	I can put it in.
1743150	1745430	Bro, this guy gets on television today.
1745510	1747710	You don't have to get it in there, but you guys can look it up.
1748669	1750169	This guy gets on TV today.
1750729	1751489	Today is Monday.
1751809	1753249	Okay, you're hearing this on Tuesday.
1753669	1762309	And he fucking says, the United States is going to have to send its sons and daughters to fight in Ukraine, and they will die.
1762509	1765169	That's what he said, his almost verbatim exact quote.
1766429	1774069	Dude, if we send a single soldier over there, like a single fucking soldier, this administration is no different than any other one.
1774149	1774249	100%.
1774769	1775149	Yeah.
1775309	1776229	Yeah, 100%, man.
1776867	1780667	But yeah, I mean he goes over it goes back to Europe and decides to do this little tour
1780667	1782667	So he stopped to stop in the UK
1783087	1787687	He went to the UK first. He went to the UK to get some of that terrible food. They got over there
1789107	1791307	Gordon Ramsay's only one knows how to make food over there
1793727	1795727	That's why he's so fucking famous, bro
1796387	1800247	That's why Gordon Ramsay's so famous because he's the only one over there who knows how to make food
